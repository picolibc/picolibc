This folder is used to build QEMU specific device trees for MicroBlaze architecture.
These device trees are used by the QEMU provided by Xilinx to internally generate machine models.

To build the device trees:
   1. Obtain device-tree-compiler from a package manager.
   2. You must have dtc on your PATH, or specify DTC= env to a dtc executable.
   3. Run make in this directory

This will overwrite board-microblaze-zephyr-demo.dtb in the parent directory.
The command should clean all temporary files.
