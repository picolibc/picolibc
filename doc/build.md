# Building Picolibc

Picolibc is designed to be cross-compiled for embedded systems on a
Linux host using GCC. There is some support for Clang, but that
doesn't include the built-in multilib support. Picolibc uses the meson
build system, which is a slightly quirky build system designed to
replace autotools with a single language.

Picolibc requires meson version 0.50 or newer. If your operating
system provides an older version, you can get the latest using
pip. For example, on a Debian or Ubuntu system, you would do:

    $ sudo apt install pip
    $ pip install meson

On POSIX systems, meson uses the low-level 'ninja' build tool and
currently requires at least ninja version 1.5. If your operating
system doesn't provide at least this version, head over to
[ninja-build.org](https://ninja-build.org) to find out how to
download and install the latest bits.

## Selecting build options

Use -D<option-name>=<value> on the meson command line to change from
the default value. Many of these options set configuration values for
the newlib code base and should match that configuration system. The
defaults should be reasonable for small embedded systems.

### General build options

These options control some general build configuration values.

| Option                      | Default | Description                                                                          |
| ------                      | ------- | -----------                                                                          |
| fast-strcmp                 | true    | Always optimize strcmp for performance (to make Dhrystone happy)                     |

| have-format-attribute       | auto    | Compiler supports __format__ attribute (default autodetected)                        |
| multilib                    | true    | Build every multilib configuration supported by the compiler                         |
| multilib-list               | <empty> | If non-empty, the set of multilib configurations to compile for                      |
| native-tests                | false   | Build tests against native libc (used to validate tests)                             |
| picolib                     | true    | Include picolib bits for tls and sbrk support                                        |
| picocrt                     | true    | Build crt0.o (C startup function)                                                    |
| picocrt-lib                 | true    | Also wrap crt0.o into a library -lcrt0, which is easier to find via the library path |
| semihost                    | true    | Build the semihost library (libsemihost.a)                                           |
| fake-semihost               | false   | Create a fake semihost library to allow tests to link                                |
| specsdir                    | auto    | Where to install the .specs file (default is in the GCC directory). <br> If set to `none`, then picolibc.specs will not be installed at all.|
| sysroot-install             | false   | Install in GCC sysroot location (requires sysroot in GCC)                            |
| tests                       | false   | Enable tests                                                                         |
| tinystdio                   | true    | Use tiny stdio from avr libc                                                         |

### Options applying to both legacy stdio and tinystdio

These options extend support in printf and scanf for additional
types and formats.

| Option                      | Default | Description                                                                          |
| ------                      | ------- | -----------                                                                          |
| io-c99-formats              | true    | Enable C99 support in IO functions like printf/scanf                                 |
| io-long-long                | false   | Enable long long type support in IO functions like printf/scanf. For tiny-stdio, this only affects the integer-only versions, the full version always includes long long support. |
| io-pos-args                 | false   | Enable printf-family positional arg support. For tiny-stdio, this only affects the integer-only versions, the full version always includes positional argument support. |
| io-long-double              | false   | Enable long double support in printf/scanf.                                          |


`long long` support is always enabled for the tinystdio full
printf/scanf modes, the `io-long-long` option adds them to the limited
(float and integer) versions, as well as to the original newlib stdio
bits.

### Options when using tinystdio bits

These options apply when tinystdio is enabled, which is the
default. For stdin/stdout/stderr, the application will need to provide
`stdin`, `stdout` and `stderr`, which are three pointers to FILE
structures (which can all reference a single shared FILE structure,
and which can be aliases to the same underlying global pointer).

Note that while posix-io support is enabled by default, using it will
require that the underlying system offer the required functions. POSIX
console support offers built-in `stdin`, `stdout` and `stderr`
definitions which use the same POSIX I/O functions.

| Option                      | Default | Description                                                                          |
| ------                      | ------- | -----------                                                                          |
| atomic-ungetc               | true    | Make getc/ungetc re-entrant using atomic operations                                  |
| io-float-exact              | true    | Provide round-trip support in float/string conversions                               |
| posix-io                    | true    | Provide fopen/fdopen using POSIX I/O (requires open, close, read, write, lseek)      |
| posix-console               | false   | Use POSIX I/O for stdin/stdout/stderr                                                |
| format-default              | double  | Sets the default printf/scanf style ('double', 'float' or 'integer')                 |
| printf-aliases              | true    | Support link-time printf aliases to set the default printf/scanf variant             |
| io-percent-b                | false   | Support the %b as proposed in the upcoming C standard                                |
| printf-small-ultoa          | false   | Avoid soft division routine during integer binary to decimal conversion in printf    |
| minimal-io-long-long        | false   | Support long long integers in the minimal printf and scanf variants                  |
| fast-bufio                  | false   | Improve performance of some I/O operations when using bufio                          |


### Options when using legacy stdio bits

Normally, Picolibc is built with the small stdio library adapted from
avrlibc (tinystdio=true). It still has the original newlib
stdio bits and those still work (tinystdio=false), but depend
on POSIX I/O functions from the underlying system, and perform many
malloc calls at runtime. These options are relevant only in that
configuration

| Option                      | Default | Description                                                                          |
| ------                      | ------- | -----------                                                                          |
| newlib-elix-level           |  0      | Extends stdio API based on level                                                     |
| newlib-fseek-optimization   | false   | Enable fseek optimization                                                            |
| newlib-fvwrite-in-streamio  | false   | Enable iov in streamio                                                               |
| newlib-global-stdio-streams | false   | Enable global stdio streams                                                          |
| newlib-have-fcntl           | false   | System has fcntl function available                                                  |
| newlib-io-float             | false   | Enable printf/scanf family float support                                             |
| newlib-io-long-double       | false   | Enable long double type support in IO functions printf/scanf                         |
| newlib-nano-formatted-io    | false   | Use nano version formatted IO                                                        |
| newlib-reent-small          | false   | Enable small reentrant struct support                                                |
| newlib-stdio64              | true    | Include 64-bit APIs                                                                  |
| newlib-unbuf-stream-opt     | false   | Enable unbuffered stream optimization in streamio                                    |
| newlib-wide-orient          | false   | Turn off wide orientation in streamio                                                |

### Internationalization options

These options control which character sets are supported by iconv.

| Option                      | Default | Description                                                                          |
| ------                      | ------- | -----------                                                                          |
| newlib-iconv-encodings      | <empty> | Comma-separated list of iconv encodings to be built-in (default all supported). <br> Set to `none` to disable all encodings. |
| newlib-iconv-from-encodings | <empty> | Comma-separated list of "from" iconv encodings to be built-in (default iconv-encodings) |
| newlib-iconv-to-encodings   | <empty> | Comma-separated list of "to" iconv encodings to be built-in (default iconv-encodings) |
| newlib-iconv-external-ccs   | false   | Use file system to store iconv tables. Requires fopen. (default built-in to memory)  |
| newlib-iconv-dir            | libdir/locale | Directory to install external CCS files. Only used with newlib-iconv-external-ccs=true |
| newlib-iconv-runtime-dir    | newlib-iconv-dir | Directory to read external CCS files from at runtime. |

These options control how much Locale support is included in the
library. By default, picolibc only supports the 'C' locale.

| Option                      | Default | Description                                                                          |
| ------                      | ------- | -----------                                                                          |
| newlib-locale-info          | false   | Enable locale support                                                                |
| newlib-locale-info-extended | false   | Enable even more locale support                                                      |
| newlib-mb                   | false   | Enable multibyte support                                                             |

### Startup/shutdown options

These control how much support picolibc includes for calling functions
at startup and shutdown times.

| Option                      | Default | Description                                                                          |
| ------                      | ------- | -----------                                                                          |
| lite-exit                   | true    | Enable lightweight exit                                                             |
| newlib-atexit-dynamic-alloc | false   | Enable dynamic allocation of atexit entries                                          |
| newlib-global-atexit        | false   | Enable atexit data structure as global, instead of in TLS. <br> If `thread-local-storage` == false, then the atexit data structure is always global. |
| newlib-initfini             | true    | Support _init() and _fini() functions in picocrt                                     |
| newlib-initfini-array       | true    | Use .init_array and .fini_array sections in picocrt                                  |
| newlib-register-fini        | false   | Enable finalization function registration using atexit                               |
| crt-runtime-size            | false   | Compute .data/.bss sizes at runtime rather than linktime. <br> This option exists for targets where the linker can't handle a symbol that is the difference between two other symbols, e.g. m68k.|

### Thread local storage support

By default, Picolibc can uses native TLS support as provided by the
compiler, this allows re-entrancy into the library if the run-time
environment supports that. A TLS model is specified only when TLS is
enabled. The default TLS model is local-exec.

As a separate option, you can make `errno` not use TLS if necessary.

| Option                      | Default | Description                                                                          |
| ------                      | ------- | -----------                                                                          |
| thread-local-storage        | auto    | Use TLS for global variables. Default is automatic based on compiler support         |
| tls-model                   | local-exec | Select TLS model (global-dynamic, local-dynamic, initial-exec or local-exec)      |
| newlib-global-errno         | false   | Use single global errno even when thread-local-storage=true                          |
| errno-function              | <empty> | If set, names a function which returns the address of errno. 'auto' will try to auto-detect. |

### Malloc option

Picolibc offers two malloc implementations, the larger version offers
better performance on large memory systems and for applications doing
a lot of variable-sized allocations and deallocations. The smaller,
default, implementation works best when applications perform few,
persistent allocations.

| Option                      | Default | Description                                                                          |
| ------                      | ------- | -----------                                                                          |
| newlib-nano-malloc          | true    | Use small-footprint nano-malloc implementation                                       |

### Locking support

There are some functions in picolibc that use global data that needs
protecting when accessed by multiple threads. The largest set of these
are the legacy stdio code, but there are other functions that can use
locking, e.g. when newlib-global-atexit is enabled, calls to atexit
need to lock the shared global data structure if they may be called
from multiple threads at the same time. By default, these are enabled
and use the retargetable API defined in [locking.md](locking.md).

| Option                      | Default | Description                                                                          |
| ------                      | ------- | -----------                                                                          |
| newlib-retargetable-locking | true    | Allow locking routines to be retargeted at link time                                 |
| newlib-multithread          | true    | Enable support for multiple threads                                                  |


### Legacy newlib options

These either have no effect or should not be enabled in normal use of
picolibc, they're left in the library to help users porting from
newlib environments.

| Option                      | Default | Description                                                                          |
| ------                      | ------- | -----------                                                                          |
| newlib-long-time_t          | false   | Define time_t to long instead of using a 64-bit type                                 |
| newlib-supplied-syscalls    | false   | Enable newlib supplied syscalls (obsolete)                                           |
| newlib-reentrant-syscalls-provided| false| Underlying system provides reentrant syscall API                                  |
| newlib-missing-syscall-names| false   | Underlying system provides syscall names without leading underscore                  |

### Math library options

There are two versions of many libm functions, old ones from SunPro
and new ones from ARM. The new ones are generally faster for targets
with hardware double support, except that the new float-valued
functions use double-precision computations. On sytems without
hardware double support, that's going to pull in soft double
code. Measurements show the old routines are generally more accurate,
which is why they are enabled by default.

POSIX requires many of the math functions to set errno when exceptions
occur; disabling that makes them only support fenv() exception
reporting, which is what IEEE floating point and ANSI C standards
require.

| Option                      | Default | Description                                             |

| newlib-obsolete-math-double | auto    | Use old code for double-valued functions                |
| want-math-errno             | false   | Set errno when exceptions occur                         |

newlib-obsolete-math provides the default value for the
newlib-obsolete-math-float and newlib-obsolete-math-double parameters;
those control the compilation of the individual fucntions.

## Building for embedded RISC-V and ARM systems

Meson sticks all of the cross-compilation build configuration bits in
a separate configuration file. There are a bunch of things you need to
set, which the build system really shouldn't care about. Example
configuration settings for RISC-V processors are in
cross-riscv64-unknown-elf.txt:

    [binaries]
    c = 'riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc'
    ar = 'riscv64-unknown-elf-ar'
    as = 'riscv64-unknown-elf-as'
    ld = 'riscv64-unknown-elf-ld'
    strip = 'riscv64-unknown-elf-strip'

    [host_machine]
    system = 'unknown'
    cpu_family = 'riscv'
    cpu = 'riscv'
    endian = 'little'

    [properties]
    c_args = [ '-nostdlib', '-msave-restore', '-fno-common' ]
    # default multilib is 64 bit
    c_args_ = [ '-mcmodel=medany' ]
    needs_exe_wrapper = true
    skip_sanity_check = true

Settings for ARM processors are in cross-arm-none-eabi.txt:

    [binaries]
    c = 'arm-none-eabi-gcc'
    ar = 'arm-none-eabi-ar'
    as = 'arm-none-eabi-as'
    ld = 'arm-none-eabi-ld'
    strip = 'arm-none-eabi-strip'

    [host_machine]
    system = 'none'
    cpu_family = 'arm'
    cpu = 'arm'
    endian = 'little'

    [properties]
    c_args = [ '-nostdlib', '-fno-common' ]
    needs_exe_wrapper = true
    skip_sanity_check = true

If those programs aren't in your path, you can edit the file to point
wherever they may be.

### Auto-detecting the compiler multi-lib configurations

The PicoLibc configuration detects the processor configurations
supported by the compiler using the `--print-multi-lib` command-line option:

On RISC-V, PicoLibc is compiled 36 times, while on ARM, the library is
compiled 20 times with the specified compiler options (replace the
'@'s with '-' to see what they will be).

### Running meson

Because Picolibc targets smaller systems like the SiFive FE310 or ARM
Cortex-M0 parts with only a few kB of RAM and flash, the default
values for all of the configuration options are designed to minimize
the library code size. Here's the
[do-riscv-configure](../scripts/do-riscv-configure) script from the repository
that configures the library for small RISC-V systems:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
ARCH=riscv64-unknown-elf
DIR=`dirname $0`
meson "$DIR" \
    -Dincludedir=picolibc/$ARCH/include \
    -Dlibdir=picolibc/$ARCH/lib \
    --cross-file "$DIR"/cross-$ARCH.txt \
    "$@"
```

This script is designed to be run from a build directory, so you'd do:

    $ mkdir build-riscv64-unknown-elf
    $ cd build-riscv64-unknown-elf
    $ ../scripts/do-riscv-configure

You can select the installation directory by passing it to the meson script:

    $ ../scripts/do-riscv-configure -Dprefix=/path/to/install/dir/

### Compiling

Once configured, you can compile the libraries with

    $ ninja
    ...
    $ ninja install
    ...
    $
