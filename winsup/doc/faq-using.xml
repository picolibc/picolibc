<question><para>Why can't my application locate cygncurses-8.dll?  or cygintl-3.dll?  or cygreadline6.dll?  or ...?</para></question>
<answer>

<para>Well, something has gone wrong somehow...
</para>
<para>To repair the damage, you must run Cygwin Setup again, and re-install the
package which provides the missing DLL package.
</para>
<para>If you already installed the package at one point, Cygwin Setup won't
show the option to install the package by default.  In the
``Select packages to install'' dialog, click on the <literal>Full/Part</literal>
button.  This lists all packages, even those that are already
installed.  Scroll down to locate the missing package, for instance
<literal>libncurses8</literal>.  Click on the ``cycle'' glyph until it says
``Reinstall''.  Continue with the installation.

<answer>

<para>If suddenly <emphasis>every</emphasis> command takes a

access a network share.  You may have the obsolete <literal>//c</literal>

<qandaentry id="faq.using.filename-spaces">
<question><para>Can I use paths/filenames containing spaces in them?</para></question>
<answer>

<para>Cygwin does support spaces in filenames and paths.  That said, some
utilities that use the library may not, since files don't typically
contain spaces in Unix.  If you stumble into problems with this, you
will need to either fix the utilities or stop using spaces in filenames
used by Cygwin tools.
</para>
<para>In particular, bash interprets space as a word separator.  You would have
to quote a filename containing spaces, or escape the space character.
For example:
<screen>

<qandaentry id="faq.using.shortcuts">
<question><para>Why can't I cd into a shortcut to a directory?</para></question>
<answer>

<para>Cygwin does not follow MS Windows Explorer Shortcuts
(*.lnk files).  It sees a shortcut as a regular file and this you
cannot "cd" into it.
</para>
<para>Cygwin is also capable to create POSIX symlinks as Windows shortcuts 
(see the CYGWIN environment variable option "winsymlinks"), but these
shortcuts are different from shortcuts created by native Windows
applications.  Windows applications can usually make use of Cygwin
shortcuts but not vice versa.  This is by choice.  The reason is that
Windows shortcuts may contain a bunch of extra information which would
get lost, if, for example, Cygwin tar archives and extracts them as
symlinks.
</para>
<para>Changing a Cygwin shortcut in Windows Explorer usually changes a Cygwin
shortcut into a Windows native shortcut.  Afterwards, Cygwin will not
recognize it as symlink anymore.

<qandaentry id="faq.using.find">
<question><para>I'm having basic problems with find.  Why?</para></question>
<answer>

<para>Make sure you are using the find that came with Cygwin and that you
aren't picking up the Win32 find command instead.  You can verify that
you are getting the right one by doing a "type find" in bash.
</para>
<para>If the path argument to find, including current directory (default), is
itself a symbolic link, then find will not traverse it unless you
specify the <literal>-follow</literal> option.  This behavior is different than most
other UNIX implementations, but is not likely to change.
</para>
<para>If find does not seem to be producing enough results, or seems to be
missing out some directories, you may be experiencing a problem with one
of find's optimisations.  The absence of <literal>.</literal> and <literal>..</literal>
directories on some filesystems, such as DVD-R UDF, can confuse find.

<qandaentry id="faq.using.shell-scripts">
<question><para>Why doesn't my shell script work?</para></question>
<answer>

<para>There are two basic problems you might run into.  One is the fact that

It could be missing some features you might expect in
<command>/bin/sh</command>, if you are used to <command>/bin/sh</command>
actually being <command>zsh</command> (MacOS X "Panther") or
<command>ksh</command> (Tru64).  
</para>

<para>Or, it could be a permission problem, and Cygwin doesn't understand
that your script is executable.  On NTFS or NFS just make the script
executable using <literal>chmod +x</literal>.  However,
<literal>chmod</literal> may not work due to restrictions of the
filesystem (see FAQ entry above).  In this case Cygwin must read the
contents of files to determine if they are executable.  If your script
does not start with
</para>
<screen>
	#! /bin/sh
</screen>

<para>(or any path to a script interpreter, it does not have to be /bin/sh)
then Cygwin will not know it is an executable script.  The Bourne shell
idiom
</para>
<screen>
	:
	# This is the 2nd line, assume processing by /bin/sh
</screen>

<para>also works.
</para>
<para>Note that you can use the filesystem flag <literal>cygexec</literal> in
<filename>/etc/fstab</filename> to force Cygwin to treat all files
under the mount point as executable.  This can be used for individual
files as well as directories.  Then Cygwin will not bother to read files

Actually, if you are very careful, you can have two different versions

the DLLs is a pre-1.7 DLL and the other is a 1.7.0 or later DLL.  These
DLLs can work concurrently without knowing about each other due to
massive changes using shared resources in Cygwin 1.7.  However,
processes using different DLLs will not interact with each other
correctly, so keep them separate except you really really know what
you're doing.

It depends on what you mean by "break".  If the application installs a

Remember that the Cygwin DLL strives to be backwards compatible so a

<para>Cygwin has a builtin "cygdrive prefix" for drives that are not mounted.
You can access any drive, say Z:, as '/cygdrive/z/'.
</para>
<para>In some applications (notably bash), you can use the familiar windows
&lt;drive&gt;:/path/, using posix forward-slashes ('/') instead of Windows
backward-slashes ('\').  (But see the warning below!)  This maps in the
obvious way to the Windows path, but will be converted internally to use
the Cygwin path, following mounts (default or explicit).  For example:
<screen>
	bash$ cd C:/Windows

        /cygdrive/c/Windows
</screen>
and
<screen>
	bash$ cd C:/cygwin

Windows path, but these would have to be escaped from the shell.
</para>
<para><emphasis role='bold'>Warning:</emphasis> There is some ambiguity in going from a Windows path
to the posix path, because different posix paths, through different

because different mount points may be binmode or textmode, so the
behavior of Cygwin apps will vary depending on the posix path used to
get there.
</para>
<para>You can avoid the ambiguity of Windows paths, and avoid typing
"/cygdrive", by explicitly mounting drives to posix paths.  For example:

stack (with the 'layered service provider' API) and install hooks
throughout.  Sadly the mailing list archives are littered with examples
of poorly written firewall-type software that causes things to break.
Note that with many of these products, simply disabling the firewall
does not remove these changes; it must be completely uninstalled.

<qandaentry id="faq.using.case-sensitive">
<question><para>Is Cygwin case-sensitive??</para></question>
<answer>

<para>Several Unix programs expect to be able to use to filenames
spelled the same way, but with different case.  A prime example
of this is perl's configuration script, which wants
<literal>Makefile</literal> and <literal>makefile</literal>.  Windows can't
tell the difference between files with just different case, so the
configuration fails.
</para>
<para>To help with this problem, Cygwin supports casesensitivity
starting with Cygwin 1.7.0.  For a detailed description how to use that
feature see the Cygwin User's Guilde at

<qandaentry id="faq.using.dos-filenames">
<question><para>What about DOS special filenames?</para></question>
<answer>

<para>In Windows, files cannot be named com1, lpt1, or aux (to name a few);
either as the root filename or as the extension part.  If you do, you'll have
trouble.  Unix programs don't avoid these names which can make things
interesting.  E.g., the perl distribution has a file called
<literal>aux.sh</literal>.  The perl configuration tries to make sure that
<literal>aux.sh</literal> is there, but an operation on a file with the magic
letters 'aux' in it will hang.
</para>
<para>At least that's what happens when using native Windows tools.  Cygwin
1.7.0 and later can deal with these filenames just fine.  Again, see the

<qandaentry id="faq.using.directory-structure">
<question><para>Why the weird directory structure?</para></question>
<answer>

<para>Why do /lib and /usr/lib (and /bin, /usr/bin) point to the same thing?
</para>
<para>Why use mounts instead of symbolic links?
</para>
<para>Can I use a disk root (e.g., C:\) as Cygwin root?  Why is this discouraged?
</para>
<para>After a new installation in the default location, your mount points will
look something like this:
</para>
<screen>
	bash$ mount
	C:\cygwin\bin on /usr/bin type ntfs (binary,auto)
	C:\cygwin\lib on /usr/lib type ntfs (binary,auto)
	C:\cygwin on / type ntfs (binary,auto)
	C: on /cygdrive/c type ntfs (binary,posix=0,user,noumount,auto)
</screen>

<para>Note that /bin and /usr/bin point to the same location, as do /lib and
/usr/lib.  This is intentional, and you should not undo these mounts
unless you <emphasis>really</emphasis> know what you are doing.
</para>
<para>Various applications and packages may expect to be installed in /lib or
/usr/lib (similarly /bin or /usr/bin).  Rather than distinguish between
them and try to keep track of them (possibly requiring the occasional
duplication or symbolic link), it was decided to maintain only one
actual directory, with equivalent ways to access it.
</para>
<para>Symbolic links had been considered for this purpose, but were dismissed
because they do not always work on Samba drives.  Also, mounts are
faster to process because no disk access is required to resolve them.
</para>
<para>Note that non-cygwin applications will not observe Cygwin mounts (or
symlinks for that matter).  For example, if you use WinZip to unpack the
tar distribution of a Cygwin package, it may not get installed to the
correct Cygwin path.  <emphasis>So don't do this!</emphasis>
</para>
<para>It is strongly recommended not to make the Cygwin root directory the
same as your drive's root directory, unless you know what you are doing
and are prepared to deal with the consequences.  It is generally easier
to maintain the Cygwin hierarchy if it is isolated from, say, C:\.  For
one thing, you avoid possible collisions with other (non-cygwin)
applications that may create (for example) \bin and \lib directories.

things you might add in the future?)

<question><para>How do anti-virus programs like Cygwin?</para></question>
<answer>

<para>Users have reported that NAI (formerly McAfee) VirusScan for NT (and
others?) is incompatible with Cygwin.  This is because it tries to scan
the newly loaded shared memory in cygwin1.dll, which can cause fork() to
fail, wreaking havoc on many of the tools.  (It is not confirmed that
this is still a problem, however.)
</para>
<para>There have been several reports of NAI VirusScan causing the system to
hang when unpacking tar.gz archives.  This is surely a bug in VirusScan,
and should be reported to NAI.  The only workaround is to disable
VirusScan when accessing these files.  This can be an issue during
setup, and is discussed in that FAQ entry.
</para>
<para>Some users report a significant performance hit using Cygwin when their
anti-virus software is enabled.  Rather than disable the anti-virus
software completely, it may be possible to specify directories whose
contents are exempt from scanning.  In a default installation, this
would be <literal>C:\cygwin\bin</literal>.  Obviously, this could be
exploited by a hostile non-Cygwin program, so do this at your own risk.

<para>The previous generation of Windows,

<question><para>What applications have been found to interfere with Cygwin?</para></question>
<answer>

<para>From time to time, people have reported strange failures and problems in
Cygwin and Cygwin packages that seem to have no rational explanation.  Among
the most common symptoms they report are fork failures, memory leaks, and file
access denied problems.  These problems, when they have been traced, often appear
to be caused by interference from other software installed on the same PC.  Security
software, in particular, such as anti-virus, anti-spyware, and firewall applications,
often implements its functions by installing hooks into various parts of the system,
including both the Explorer shell and the underlying kernel.  Sometimes these hooks
are not implemented in an entirely transparent fashion, and cause changes in the
behaviour which affect the operation of other programs, such as Cygwin.

<para>Sometimes these problems can be worked around, by temporarily or partially
disabling the offending software.  For instance, it may be possible to disable
on-access scanning in your antivirus, or configure it to ignore files under the
Cygwin installation root.  Often, unfortunately, this is not possible; even disabling
the software may not work, since many applications that hook the operating system
leave their hooks installed when disabled, and simply set them into what is intended
to be a completely transparent pass-through mode.  Sometimes this pass-through is not
as transparent as all that, and the hooks still interfere with Cygwin; in these cases,
it may be necessary to uninstall the software altogether to restore normal operation.
</para>
<para>Some of the symptoms you may experience are:</para>
<para><itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>Random fork() failures.</para>
<para>Caused by hook DLLs that load themselves into every process in the
system.  POSIX fork() semantics require that the memory map of the child process
must be an exact duplicate of the parent process' layout.  If one of these DLLs
loads itself at a different base address in the child's memory space as compared
to the address it was loaded at in the parent, it can end up taking the space that
belonged to a different DLL in the parent.  When Cygwin can't load the original
DLL at that same address in the child, the fork() call has to fail.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>File access problems.</para>
<para>Some programs (e.g., virus scanners with on-access scanning) scan or
otherwise operate on every file accessed by all the other software running on
your computer.  In some cases they may retain an open handle on the file even
after the software that is really using the file has closed it.  This has been
known to cause operations such as deletes, renames and moves to fail with
access denied errors.  In extreme cases it has been known for scanners to leak
file handles, leading to kernel memory starvation.

<para>Networking issues</para>
<para>Firewall software sometimes gets a bit funny about Cygwin.  It's not
currently understood why; Cygwin only uses the standard Winsock2 API, but
perhaps in some less-commonly used fashion that doesn't get as well tested
by the publishers of firewalls.  Symptoms include mysterious failures to
connect, or corruption of network data being sent or received.</para>

<listitem>
<para>Memory and/or handle leaks</para>
<para>Some applications that hook into the Windows operating system exhibit
bugs when interacting with Cygwin that cause them to leak allocated memory
or other system resources.  Symptoms include complaints about out-of-memory
errors and even virtual memory exhaustion dialog boxes from the O/S; it is
often possible to see the excess memory allocation using a tool such as
Task Manager or Sysinternals' Process Explorer, although interpreting the
statistics they present is not always straightforward owing to complications
such as virtual memory paging and file caching.</para>
