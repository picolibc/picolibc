<sect2 id="pathnames-intro"><title>Introduction</title>

<para>Cygwin supports both Win32- and POSIX-style paths.  Directory
delimiters may be either forward slashes or backslashes.  Paths using
backslashes are always handled as Win32 paths.  POSIX paths must only
use forward slashes as delimiter, otherwise they are treated as Win32
paths and file access might fail in surprising ways.  Note that the
usage of Win32 paths, though possible, is deprecated, since it
circumvents important internal path handling mechanisms.  UNC pathnames
(starting with two slashes and a network name) are also supported.
</para>

<para>POSIX operating systems (such as Linux) do not have the concept
of drive letters.  Instead, all absolute paths begin with a
slash (instead of a drive letter such as "c:") and all file systems
appear as subdirectories (for example, you might buy a new disk and
make it be the <filename>/disk2</filename> directory).</para>

<para>Because many programs written to run on UNIX systems assume
the existance of a single unified POSIX file system structure, Cygwin
maintains a special internal POSIX view of the Win32 file system
that allows these programs to successfully run under Windows.  Cygwin
uses this mapping to translate from POSIX to Win32 paths as
necessary.</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="mount-table"><title>The Cygwin Mount Table</title>

<para>The <filename>/etc/fstab</filename> file is used to map Win32
drives and network shares into Cygwin's internal POSIX directory tree.
This is a similar concept to the typical UNIX fstab file.  The mount
points stored in <filename>/etc/fstab</filename> are globally set for
all users.  Sometimes there's a requirement to have user specific
mount points.  The Cygwin DLL supports user specific fstab files.
These are stored in the directory <filename>/etc/fstab.d</filename>
and the name of the file is the Cygwin username of the user, as it's
stored in the <filename>/etc/passwd</filename> file.  The content of the
user specifc file is identical to the system-wide
<filename>fstab</filename> file.</para>

<para>The file fstab contains descriptive information about the various file
systems.  fstab is only read by programs, and not written; it is the
duty of the system administrator to properly create and maintain this
file.  Each filesystem is described on a separate line; fields on each
line are separated by tabs or spaces.  Lines starting with '#' are
comments.</para>

<para>The first field describes the block special device or
remote filesystem to be mounted.  On Cygwin, this is the native Windows
path which the mount point links in.  As path separator you MUST use a
slash.  Usage of a backslash might lead to unexpected results.  UNC
paths (using slashes, not backslashes) are allowed.  If the path
contains spaces these can be escaped as <literal>'\040'</literal>.</para>

<para>The second field describes the mount point for the filesystem. 
If the name of the mount point contains spaces these can be
escaped as '\040'.</para>

<para>The third field describes the type of the filesystem.
Cygwin supports any string here, since the file system type is usually
not evaluated.  The notable exception is the file system type
cygdrive.  This type is used to set the cygdrive prefix.</para>

<para>The fourth field describes the mount options associated
with the filesystem.  It is formatted as a comma separated list of
options.  It contains at least the type of mount (binary or text) plus
any additional options appropriate to the filesystem type.  Recognized
options are binary, text, nouser, user, exec, notexec, cygexec, nosuid,
posix=[0|1].  The meaning of the options is as follows.</para>

<screen>
  acl       - Cygwin uses the filesystem's access control lists (ACLs) to
              implement real POSIX permissions (default).  This flag only
	      affects filesystems supporting ACLs (NTFS) and is ignored
	      otherwise.
  auto      - Ignored.
  binary    - Files default to binary mode (default).
  cygexec   - Treat all files below mount point as cygwin executables.
  exec      - Treat all files below mount point as executable.
  noacl     - Cygwin ignores filesystem ACLs and only fakes a subset of
	      permission bits based on the DOS readonly attribute.  This
	      behaviour is the default on FAT and FAT32.  The flag is
	      ignored on NFS filesystems.
  nosuid    - No suid files are allowed (currently unimplemented).
  notexec   - Treat all files below mount point as not executable.
  nouser    - Mount is a system-wide mount.
  override  - Force the override of an immutable mount point (currently "/").
  posix=0   - Switch off case sensitivity for paths under this mount point
	      (default for the cygdrive prefix).
  posix=1   - Switch on case sensitivity for paths under this mount point
	      (default for all other mount points).
  text      - Files default to CRLF text mode line endings.
  user      - Mount is a user mount.
</screen>

<para>While normally the execute permission bits are used to evaluate
executability, this is not possible on filesystems which don't support
permissions at all (like FAT/FAT32), or if ACLs are ignored on filesystems
supporting them (see the aforementioned <literal>acl</literal> mount option).
In these cases, the following heuristic is used to evaluate if a file is
executable: Files ending in certain extensions (.exe, .com, .bat, .btm,
.cmd) are assumed to be executable.  Files whose first two characters begin
with '#!' are also considered to be executable.
The <literal>exec</literal> option is used to instruct Cygwin that the
mounted file is "executable".  If the <literal>exec</literal> option is used
with a directory then all files in the directory are executable.
This option allows other files to be marked as executable and avoids the
overhead of opening each file to check for a '#!'.  The
<literal>cygexec</literal> option is very similar to <literal>exec</literal>,
but also prevents Cygwin from setting up commands and environment variables
for a normal Windows program, adding another small performance gain.  The
opposite of these options is the <literal>notexec</literal> option, which
means that no files should be marked as executable under that mount point.</para>
<para>A correct root directory is quite essential to the operation of
Cygwin.  A default root directory is evaluated at startup so a
<filename>fstab</filename> entry for the root directory is not necessary.
If it's wrong, nothing will work as expected.  Therefore, the root directory
evaluated by Cygwin itself is treated as an immutable mount point and can't
be overridden in /etc/fstab... unless you think you really know what you're
doing.  In this case, use the <literal>override</literal> flag in the options
field in the <filename>/etc/fstab</filename> file.  Since this is a dangerous
thing to do, do so at your own risk.</para>

<para><filename>/usr/bin</filename> and <filename>/usr/lib</filename> are
by default also automatic mount points generated by the Cygwin DLL similar
to the way the root directory is evaluated.  <filename>/usr/bin</filename>
points to the directory the Cygwin DLL is installed in,
<filename>/usr/lib</filename> is supposed to point to the
<filename>/lib</filename> directory.  This choice is safe and usually
shouldn't be changed.  An fstab entry for them is not required.</para>

<para><literal>nouser</literal> mount points are not overridable by a later
call to <command>mount</command>.
Mount points given in <filename>/etc/fstab</filename> are by default
<literal>nouser</literal> mount points, unless you specify the option
<literal>user</literal>.  This allows the administrator to set certain
paths so that they are not overridable by users.  In contrast, all mount
points in the user specific fstab file are <literal>user</literal> mount
points.</para>

<para>The fifth and sixth field are ignored.  They are
so far only specified to keep a Linux-like fstab file layout.</para>

<para>Note that you don't have to specify an fstab entry for the root dir,
unless you want to have the root dir pointing to somewhere entirely
different (hopefully you know what you're doing), or if you want to
mount the root dir with special options (for instance, as text mount).</para>

<para>Whenever Cygwin generates a Win32 path from a POSIX one, it uses
the longest matching prefix in the mount table.  Thus, if
<filename>C:</filename> is mounted as <filename>/c</filename> and also
as <filename>/</filename>, then Cygwin would translate
<filename>C:/foo/bar</filename> to <filename>/c/foo/bar</filename>.
This translation is normally only used when trying to derive the
POSIX equivalent current directory.  Otherwise, the handling of MS-DOS
filenames bypasses the mount table.
</para>

<para>If you want to see the current set of mount points valid in your
session, you can invoking the Cygwin tool <command>mount</command> without
arguments:</para>

<example id="pathnames-mount-ex">
<title>Displaying the current set of mount points</title>

</screen>
</example>

<para>You can also use the <command>mount</command> command to add
new mount points, and the <command>umount</command> to delete
them.  However, since they are only noted in memory, these mount
points will disappear as soon as your last Cygwin process ends.
See <xref linkend="mount"></xref> and <xref linkend="umount"></xref> for more
information.</para>

<note><para>
When you upgrade an existing older Cygwin installation to Cygwin 1.7,
your old system mount points (stored in the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE branch
of your registry) are read by a script and the <filename>/etc/fstab</filename>
file is generated from these entries.  Note that entries for
<filename>/</filename>, <filename>/usr/bin</filename>, and
<filename>/usr/lib</filename> are <emphasis>never</emphasis> generated.
</para>

<para>
The old user mount points in your HKEY_CURRENT_USER branch of the registry
are not used to generate <filename>/etc/fstab</filename>.  If you want
to create a user specific <filename>/etc/fstab.d/${USER}</filename> file
from your old entries, there's a script available which does exactly
that for you, <filename>/bin/copy-user-registry-fstab</filename>.  Just
start the script and it will create your user specific fstab file.  Stop
all your Cygwin processes and restart them, and you can simply use your
old user mount points as before.

<sect2 id="cygdrive"><title>The cygdrive path prefix</title>

<para>As already outlined in <xref linkend="ov-hi-files"></xref>, you can
access arbitary drives on your system by using the cygdrive path prefix.
The default value for this prefix is <literal>/cygdrive</literal>, and
a path to any drive can be constructed by using the cygdrive prefix and
appending the drive letter as subdirectory, like this:</para>

<screen>
  bash$ ls -l /cygdrive/f/somedir
</screen>

<para>This lists the content of the directory F:\somedir.</para>

<para>The cygdrive prefix is a virtual directory under which all drives
on a system are subsumed.  The mount options of the cygdrive prefix is
used for all file access through the cygdrive prefixed drives.  For instance,
assuming the cygdrive mount options are <literal>binary,posix=0</literal>,
then any file <literal>/cygdrive/x/file</literal> will be opened in
binary mode by default (mount option <literal>binary</literal>, and the case
of the filename doesn't matter (mount option <literal>posix=0</literal>.
</para>

<para>The cygdrive prefix may be changed in the fstab file as outlined above.
Please note that you must not use the cygdrive prefix for any other mount
point.  For instance this:</para>

<screen>
  none /cygdrive cygdrive binary 0 0
  D:   /cygdrive/d somefs text 0 0
</screen>

<para>will not make file access using the /mnt/d path prefix suddenly using
textmode.  If you want to mount any drive explicitly in another mode than
the cygdrive prefix, use a distinct path prefix:</para>

<screen>
  none /cygdrive cygdrive binary 0 0
  D:   /mnt/d somefs text 0 0
</screen>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="pathnames-additional"><title>Additional Path-related Information</title>

<para>The <command>cygpath</command> program provides the ability to
translate between Win32 and POSIX pathnames in shell scripts. See
<xref linkend="cygpath"></xref> for the details.</para>

<para>The <envar>HOME</envar>, <envar>PATH</envar>, and
<envar>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</envar> environment variables are automatically
converted from Win32 format to POSIX format (e.g.  from
<filename>c:/cygwin\bin</filename> to <filename>/bin</filename>, if
there was a mount from that Win32 path to that POSIX path) when a Cygwin
process first starts.</para>

<para>Symbolic links can also be used to map Win32 pathnames to POSIX.
For example, the command
<command>ln -s //pollux/home/joe/data /data</command> would have about
the same effect as creating a mount point from
<filename>//pollux/home/joe/data</filename> to <filename>/data</filename>
using <command>mount</command>, except that symbolic links cannot set
the default file access mode.  Other differences are that the mapping is
distributed throughout the file system and proceeds by iteratively
walking the directory tree instead of matching the longest prefix in a
kernel table.  Note that symbolic links will only work on network
drives that are properly configured to support the "system" file
attribute.  Many do not do so by default (the Unix Samba server does
not by default, for example).</para>

</sect2>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="using-specialnames"><title>Special filenames</title>

<sect2 id="pathnames-etc"><title>Special files in /etc</title>

<para>Certain files in Cygwin's <filename>/etc</filename> directory are
read by Cygwin before the mount table has been established.  The list
of files is</para>

<screen>
  /etc/fstab
  /etc/fstab.d/$USER
  /etc/passwd
  /etc/group
</screen>

<para>These file are read using native Windows NT functions which have
no notion of Cygwin symlinks or POSIX paths.  For that reason
there are a few requirements as far as <filename>/etc</filename> is
concerned.</para>

<para>To access these files, the Cygwin DLL evaluates it's own full
Windows path, strips off the innermost directory component and adds
"\etc".  Let's assume the Cygwin DLL is installed as
<filename>C:\cygwin\bin\cygwin1.dll</filename>.  First the DLL name as
well as the innermost directory (<filename>bin</filename>) is stripped
off: <filename>C:\cygwin\</filename>.  Then "etc" and the filename to
look for is attached: <filename>C:\cygwin\etc\fstab</filename>.  So the
/etc directory must be parallel to the directory in which the cygwin1.dll
exists and <filename>/etc</filename> must not be a Cygwin symlink
pointing to another directory.  Consequentially none of the files from
the above list, including the directory <filename>/etc/fstab.d</filename>
is allowed to be a Cygwin symlink either.</para>

<para>However, native NTFS symlinks and reparse points are transparent
when accessing the above files so all these files as well as
<filename>/etc</filename> itself may be NTFS symlinks or reparse
points.</para>

<para>Last but not least, make sure that these files are world-readable.
Every process of any user account has to read these files potentially,
so world-readability is essential.  The only exception are the user
specific files <filename>/etc/fstab.d/$USER</filename>, which only have
to be readable by the $USER user account itself.</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="pathnames-dosdevices"><title>Invalid filenames</title>

<para>Filenames invalid under Win32 are not necessarily invalid
under Cygwin since release 1.7.0.  There are a few rules which
apply to Windows filenames.  Most notably, DOS device names like
<filename>AUX</filename>, <filename>COM1</filename>,
<filename>LPT1</filename> or <filename>PRN</filename> (to name a few)
cannot be used as filename or extension in a native Win32 application.
So filenames like <filename>prn.txt</filename> or <filename>foo.aux</filename>
are invalid filenames for native Win32 applications.</para>

<para>This restriction doesn't apply to Cygwin applications.  Cygwin
can create and access files with such names just fine.  Just don't try
to use these files with native Win32 applications.</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="pathnames-specialchars">
<title>Forbidden characters in filenames</title>

<para>Win32 filenames can't contain trailing dots and spaces for backward
compatibility.  When trying to create files with trailing dots or spaces,
all of them are removed before the file is created.  This restriction only
affects native Win32 applications.  Cygwin applications can create and
access files with trailing dots and spaces without problems.</para>

<para>Additionally, some characters are disallowed in filenames on Windows
filesystems.  These forbidden characters are the ASCII control characters
from ASCII value 1 to 31, plus the following characters which have a special
meaning in the Win32 API:</para>

<screen>
  "   *   :   &lt;   &gt;   ?   |   \
</screen>

<para>Cygwin can't fix this, but it has a method to workaround this
restriction.  All of the above characters, except for the backslash,
are converted to special UNICODE characters in the range 0xf000 to 0xf0ff
(the "Private use area") when creating or accessing files.</para>

<para>The backslash has to be exempt from this conversion, because Cygwin
accepts Win32 filenames including backslashes as path separators on input. 
Converting backslashes using the above method would make this impossible.</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="pathnames-unusual">
<title>Filenames with unusual (foreign) characters</title>

<para> Windows filesystems use the Unicode character set in the UTF-16
encoding to store filename information.  If you don't use the UTF-8
character set (see <xref linkend="setup-locale"></xref>) then there's a
chance that a filename is using one or more characters which have no
representation in the character set you're using.</para>

<para>For instance, there are no Chinese characters in the ISO-8859-1
character set.  So, converting a filename containing a Chinese character
to ISO-8859-1 leaves you with a wrongly converted filename, for instance,
containing a question mark '?' as replacement for the unconvertable
character.  When trying to access the file, Cygwin has to convert the
filename back to UTF-16.  However, this doesn't result in the original
filename because the question mark will not translate back to the original
Chinese character, but to a simple question mark instead.  This in turn
results in strange "File not found" messages.</para>

<note><para>In the default "C" locale, Cygwin creates filenames using
the UTF-8 charset.  This will always result in some valid filename by
default, but again might impose problems when switching to a non-"C"
or non-"UTF-8" charset.</para></note>

<note><para>To avoid this scenario altogether, always use UTF-8 as the
character set.</para></note>

<para>If you don't want or can't use UTF-8 as character set for whatever
reason, you will nevertheless be able to access the file.  How does that
work?  When Cygwin converts the filename from UTF-16 to your character
set, it recognizes characters which can't be converted.  If that occurs,
Cygwin replaces the non-convertible character with a special character
sequence.  The sequence starts with an ASCII CAN character (hex code
0x18, equivalent Control-X), followed by the UTF-8 representation of the
character.  The result is a filename containing some ugly looking
characters.  While it doesn't <emphasis>look</emphasis> nice, it
<emphasis>is</emphasis> nice, because Cygwin knows how to convert this
filename back to UTF-16.  The filename will be converted using your
usual character set.  However, when Cygwin recognizes an ASCII CAN
character, it skips over the ASCII CAN and handles the following bytes as
a UTF-8 character.  Thus, the filename is symmetrically converted back to
UTF-16 and you can access the file.</para>

<note><para>Please be aware that this method is not entirely foolproof.
In some character set combinations it might not work for certain native
characters.</para>

<para>Only by using the UTF-8 charset you can avoid this problem safely.
</para></note>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="pathnames-casesensitive">
<title>Case sensitive filenames</title>

<para>In the Win32 subsystem filenames are only case-preserved, but not
case-sensitive.  You can't access two files in the same directory which
only differ by case, like <filename>Abc</filename> and
<filename>aBc</filename>.  While NTFS (and some remote filesystems)
support case-sensitivity, the NT kernel starting with Windows XP does
not support it by default.  Rather, you have to tweak a registry setting
and reboot.  For that reason, case-sensitivity can not be supported by Cygwin,
unless you change that registry value.</para>

<para>If you really want case-sensitivity in Cygwin, you can switch it
on by setting the registry value</para>

<screen>
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\kernel\obcaseinsensitive
</screen>

<para>to 0 and reboot the machine.  For least surprise, Cygwin expects
this registry value also on Windows NT4 and Windows 2000, which usually
both don't know this registry key.  If you want case-sensitivity on these
systems, create that registry value and set it to 0.  On these systems
(and <emphasis role='bold'>only</emphasis> on these systems) you don't have to reboot to bring it
into effect, rather stopping all Cygwin processes and then restarting them
is sufficient.</para>

<note>
<para>
When installing Microsoft's Services For Unix (SFU), you're asked if
you want to use case-sensitive filenames.  If you answer "yes" at this point,
the installer will change the aforementioned registry value to 0, too.  So, if
you have SFU installed, there's some chance that the registry value is already
set to case sensitivity.
</para>
</note>

<para>After you set this registry value to 0, Cygwin will be case-sensitive
by default on NTFS and NFS filesystems.  However, there are limitations: 
while two <emphasis role='bold'>programs</emphasis> <filename>Abc.exe</filename>
and <filename>aBc.exe</filename> can be created and accessed like other files,
starting applications is still case-insensitive due to Windows limitations
and so the program you try to launch may not be the one actually started.  Also,
be aware that using two filenames which only differ by case might
result in some weird interoperability issues with native Win32 applications.  
You're using case-sensitivity at your own risk.  You have been warned! </para>

<para>Even if you use case-sensitivity, it might be feasible to switch to
case-insensitivity for certain paths for better interoperability with
native Win32 applications (even if it's just Windows Explorer).  You can do
this on a per-mount point base, by using the "posix=0" mount option in
<filename>/etc/fstab</filename>, or your <filename>/etc/fstab.d/$USER</filename>
file.</para>

<para><filename>/cygdrive</filename> paths are case-insensitive by default.
The reason is that the native Windows %PATH% environment variable is not
always using the correct case for all paths in it.  As a result, if you use
case-sensitivity on the <filename>/cygdrive</filename> prefix, your shell
might claim that it can't find Windows commands like <command>attrib</command>
or <command>net</command>.  To ease the pain, the <filename>/cygdrive</filename>
path is case-insensitive by default and you have to use the "posix=1" setting
explicitly in <filename>/etc/fstab</filename> or
<filename>/etc/fstab.d/$USER</filename> to switch it to case-sensitivity,
or you have to make sure that the native Win32 %PATH% environment variable
is using the correct case for all paths throughout.</para>

<para>Note that mount points as well as device names and virtual
paths like /proc are always case-sensitive!  The only exception are
the subdirectories and filenames under /proc/registry, /proc/registry32
and /proc/registry64.  Registry access is always case-insensitive.
Read on for more information.</para>

<sect2 id="pathnames-posixdevices"> <title>POSIX devices</title>
<para>There is no need to create a POSIX <filename>/dev</filename> 
directory as Cygwin automatically simulates it internally. 
These devices cannot be seen with the command <command>ls /dev/</command>
although commands such as <command>ls /dev/tty</command> work fine.
If you want to be able to see all well-known devices in
<filename>/dev/</filename>, you can use Igor Pechtchanski's
<ulink
url="http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2004-03/txt00028.txt">create_devices.sh</ulink>
script.  This script does not add the raw disk devices, though.  Again,
it's not necessary to see an existing device in /dev to access it.  The script
is just for the fun of it.
</para>

<para>
Cygwin supports the following character devices commonly found on POSIX systems:
</para>

<screen>
/dev/null
/dev/zero
/dev/full

/dev/console	Pseudo device name for the standard console window created
		by Windows.  Same as the one used for cmd.exe.  Every one
		of them has this name.  It's not quite comparable with the
		console device on UNIX machines.

/dev/tty	The current tty of a session running in a pseudo tty.
/dev/ptmx	Pseudo tty master device.
/dev/ttym

/dev/tty0	Pseudo ttys are numbered from /dev/tty0 upwards as they are
/dev/tty1	requested.
...

/dev/ttyS0	Serial communication devices.  ttyS0 == Win32 COM1,
/dev/ttyS1	ttyS1 == COM2, etc.
...

/dev/pipe
/dev/fifo

/dev/mem	The physical memory of the machine.  Note that access to the
/dev/port	physical memory has been restricted with Windows Server 2003.
/dev/kmem	Since this OS, you can't access physical memory from user space.

/dev/kmsg	Kernel message pipe, for usage with sys logger services.

/dev/random	Random number generator.
/dev/urandom

/dev/dsp	Default sound device of the system.
</screen>

<para>
Cygwin also has several Windows-specific devices:
</para>

<screen>
/dev/com1	The serial ports, starting with COM1 which is the same as ttyS0.
/dev/com2	Please use /dev/ttySx instead.
...

/dev/conin	Same as Windows CONIN$.
/dev/conout	Same as Windows CONOUT$.
/dev/clipboard	The Windows clipboard, text only
/dev/windows	The Windows message queue.
</screen>

<para>
Block devices are accessible by Cygwin processes using fixed POSIX device
names.  These POSIX device names are generated using a direct conversion
from the POSIX namespace to the internal NT namespace.
E.g. the first harddisk is the NT internal device \device\harddisk0\partition0
or the first partition on the third harddisk is \device\harddisk2\partition1.
The first floppy in the system is \device\floppy0, the first CD-ROM is
\device\cdrom0 and the first tape drive is \device\tape0.</para>

<para>The mapping from physical device to the name of the device in the
internal NT namespace can be found in various places.  For hard disks and
CD/DVD drives, the Windows "Disk Management" utility (part of the
"Computer Management" console) shows that the mapping of "Disk 0" is
\device\harddisk0.  "CD-ROM 2" is \device\cdrom2.  Another place to find
this mapping is the "Device Management" console.  Disks have a
"Location" number, tapes have a "Tape Symbolic Name", etc.
Unfortunately, the places where this information is found is not very
well-defined.</para>

<para>
For external disks (USB-drives, CF-cards in a cardreader, etc) you can use
Cygwin to show the mapping.  <filename>/proc/partitions</filename>
contains a list of raw drives known to Cygwin.  The <command>df</command>
command shows a list of drives and their respective sizes.  If you match
the information between <filename>/proc/partitions</filename> and the
<command>df</command> output, you should be able to figure out which
external drive corresponds to which raw disk device name.</para>

<note><para>Apart from tape devices which are not block devices and are
by default accessed directly, accessing mass storage devices raw
is something you should only do if you know what you're doing and know how to
handle the information.  <emphasis role='bold'>Writing</emphasis> to a raw
mass storage device you should only do if you
<emphasis role='bold'>really</emphasis> know what you're doing and are aware
of the fact that any mistake can destroy important information, for the

Last but not least, the mapping from POSIX /dev namespace to internal
NT namespace is as follows:
</para>

if you don't like these device names, feel free to create symbolic
links as they are created on Linux systems for convenience:

<sect2 id="pathnames-exe"><title>The .exe extension</title>

<para>Win32 executable filenames end with <filename>.exe</filename>
but the <filename>.exe</filename> need not be included in the command,
so that traditional UNIX names can be used.  However, for programs that
end in <filename>.bat</filename> and <filename>.com</filename>, you
cannot omit the extension.  </para>

<para>As a side effect, the <command> ls filename</command> gives
information about <filename>filename.exe</filename> if
<filename>filename.exe</filename> exists and <filename>filename</filename>
does not.  In the same situation the function call
<function>stat("filename",..)</function> gives information about
<filename>filename.exe</filename>.  The two files can be distinguished
by examining their inodes, as demonstrated below.
<screen>
<prompt>bash$</prompt> <userinput>ls * </userinput>
a      a.exe     b.exe
<prompt>bash$</prompt> <userinput>ls -i a a.exe</userinput>

</screen>
If a shell script <filename>myprog</filename> and a program
<filename>myprog.exe</filename> coexist in a directory, the shell
script has precedence and is selected for execution of
<command>myprog</command>.  Note that this was quite the reverse up to
Cygwin 1.5.19.  It has been changed for consistency with the rest of Cygwin.
</para>

<para>The <command>gcc</command> compiler produces an executable named
<filename>filename.exe</filename> when asked to produce
<filename>filename</filename>. This allows many makefiles written
for UNIX systems to work well under Cygwin.</para>

<sect2 id="pathnames-proc"><title>The /proc filesystem</title> 
<para>
Cygwin, like Linux and other similar operating systems, supports the
<filename>/proc</filename> virtual filesystem. The files in this
directory are representations of various aspects of your system,
for example the command <userinput>cat /proc/cpuinfo</userinput> 
displays information such as what model and speed processor you have.
</para>
<para>
One unique aspect of the Cygwin <filename>/proc</filename> filesystem
is <filename>/proc/registry</filename>, see next section.
</para>
<para>
The Cygwin <filename>/proc</filename> is not as complete as the
one in Linux, but it provides significant capabilities. The
<systemitem>procps</systemitem> package contains several utilities
that use it.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="pathnames-proc-registry"><title>The /proc/registry filesystem</title>
<para>
The <filename>/proc/registry</filename> filesystem provides read-only
access to the Windows registry.  It displays each <literal>KEY</literal>
as a directory and each <literal>VALUE</literal> as a file.  As anytime
you deal with the Windows registry, use caution since changes may result
in an unstable or broken system.  There are additionally subdirectories called
<filename>/proc/registry32</filename> and <filename>/proc/registry64</filename>.
They are identical to <filename>/proc/registry</filename> on 32 bit
host OSes.  On 64 bit host OSes, <filename>/proc/registry32</filename>
opens the 32 bit processes view on the registry, while
<filename>/proc/registry64</filename> opens the 64 bit processes view.
</para>
<para>
Reserved characters ('/', '\', ':', and '%') or reserved names
(<filename>.</filename> and <filename>..</filename>) are converted by
percent-encoding:
<screen>
<prompt>bash$</prompt> <userinput>regtool list -v '\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\MountedDevices'</userinput>
...
\DosDevices\C: (REG_BINARY) = cf a8 97 e8 00 08 fe f7
...
<prompt>bash$</prompt> <userinput>cd /proc/registry/HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SYSTEM</userinput>
<prompt>bash$</prompt> <userinput>ls -l MountedDevices</userinput>

</screen>
The unnamed (default) value of a key can be accessed using the filename
<filename>@</filename>.
</para>
<para>
If a registry key contains a subkey and a value with the same name
<filename>foo</filename>, Cygwin displays the subkey as
<filename>foo</filename> and the value as <filename>foo%val</filename>.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="pathnames-at"><title>The @pathnames</title> 
<para>To circumvent the limitations on shell line length in the native
Windows command shells, Cygwin programs expand their arguments
starting with "@" in a special way.  If a file
<filename>pathname</filename> exists, the argument
<filename>@pathname</filename> expands recursively to the content of
<filename>pathname</filename>. Double quotes can be used inside the
file to delimit strings containing blank space. 
Embedded double quotes must be repeated.
In the following example compare the behaviors of the bash built-in
<command>echo</command> and of the program <command>/bin/echo</command>.</para>

<example id="pathnames-at-ex"><title> Using @pathname</title>
<screen>
<prompt>bash$</prompt> <userinput>echo  'This   is   "a     long"  line' > mylist</userinput>

@mylist
<prompt>bash$</prompt> <userinput>cmd</userinput>
