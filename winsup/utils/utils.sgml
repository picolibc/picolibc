<sect1 id="using-utils"><title>Cygwin Utilities</title>

<para>Cygwin comes with a number of command-line utilities that are
used to manage the UNIX emulation portion of the Cygwin environment.
While many of these reflect their UNIX counterparts, each was written
specifically for Cygwin.  You may use the long or short option names 
interchangeably; for example, <literal>--help</literal> and 
<literal>-h</literal> function identically. All of the Cygwin 
command-line utilities support the <literal>--help</literal> and
<literal>--version</literal> options.

       cygcheck --show-unique-object-names Cygwin-DLL
       cygcheck -h
List system information, check installed packages, or query package database.

At least one command option or a PROGRAM is required, as shown above.

  PROGRAM              list library (DLL) dependencies of PROGRAM
  -c, --check-setup    show installed version of PACKAGE and verify integrity
                       (or for all installed packages if none specified)
  -d, --dump-only      just list packages, do not verify (with -c)
  -s, --sysinfo        produce diagnostic system information (implies -c -d)
  -r, --registry       also scan registry for Cygwin settings (with -s)
  -k, --keycheck       perform a keyboard check session (must be run from a
                       plain console only, not from a pty/rxvt/xterm)
  -f, --find-package   find the package to which FILE belongs
  -l, --list-package   list contents of PACKAGE (or all packages if none given)
  -p, --package-query  search for REGEXP in the entire cygwin.com package
                       repository (requires internet connectivity)
  --delete-orphaned-installation-keys
                       Delete installation keys of old, now unused
                       installations from the registry.  Requires the right
                       to change the registry.
  --enable-unique-object-names Cygwin-DLL
  --disable-unique-object-names Cygwin-DLL
  --show-unique-object-names Cygwin-DLL
                       Enable, disable, or show the setting of the
                       \"unique object names\" setting in the Cygwin DLL
                       given as argument to this option.  The DLL path must
                       be given as valid Windows(!) path.
                       See the users guide for more information.
                       If you don't know what this means, don't change it.
  -v, --verbose        produce more verbose output
  -h, --help           annotate output with explanatory comments when given
                       with another command, otherwise print this help
  -V, --version        print the version of cygcheck and exit

Note: -c, -f, and -l only report on packages that are currently installed. To
  search all official Cygwin packages use -p instead.  The -p REGEXP matches
  package names, descriptions, and names of files/paths within all packages.
</screen>

<para>
The <command>cygcheck</command> program is a diagnostic utility for
dealing with Cygwin programs. If you are familiar with
<command>dpkg</command> or <command>rpm</command>,
<command>cygcheck</command> is similar in many ways. (The major difference
is that <command>setup.exe</command> handles installing and uninstalling
packages; see <xref linkend="internet-setup"></xref> for more information.)
</para>
<para>
The <literal>-c</literal> option checks the version and status of 
installed Cygwin packages. If you specify one or more package names,
<command>cygcheck</command> will limit its output to those packages,
or with no arguments it lists all packages. A package will be marked
<literal>Incomplete</literal> if files originally installed are no longer
present. The best thing to do in that situation is reinstall the package
with <command>setup.exe</command>. To see which files are missing, use the
<literal>-v</literal> option. If you do not need to know the status
of each package and want <command>cygcheck</command> to run faster, add the
<literal>-d</literal> option and <command>cygcheck</command> will only
output the name and version for each package.
</para>
<para>
If you list one or more programs on the command line,
<command>cygcheck</command> will diagnose the runtime environment of that
program or programs, providing the names of DLL files on which the program
depends.  If you specify the <literal>-s</literal> option,
<command>cygcheck</command> will give general system information.  If you
list one or more programs on the command line and specify
<literal>-s</literal>, <command>cygcheck</command> will report on
both.</para>
<para>
The <literal>-f</literal> option helps you to track down which package a
file came from, and <literal>-l</literal> lists all files in a package.
For example, to find out about <filename>/usr/bin/less</filename> and its
package:
<example id="utils-cygcheck-ex"><title>Example <command>cygcheck</command> usage</title>
<screen>
$ cygcheck -f /usr/bin/less
less-381-1

$ cygcheck -l less
/usr/bin/less.exe
/usr/bin/lessecho.exe
/usr/bin/lesskey.exe
/usr/man/man1/less.1
/usr/man/man1/lesskey.1
</screen>
</example>
</para>

<para>The <literal>-h</literal> option prints additional helpful
messages in the report, at the beginning of each section.  It also
adds table column headings.  While this is useful information, it also
adds some to the size of the report, so if you want a compact report
or if you know what everything is already, just leave this out.</para>

<para>The <literal>-v</literal> option causes the output to be more
verbose.  What this means is that additional information will be
reported which is usually not interesting, such as the internal
version numbers of DLLs, additional information about recursive DLL
usage, and if a file in one directory in the PATH also occurs in other
directories on the PATH.  </para>

<para>The <literal>-r</literal> option causes
<command>cygcheck</command> to search your registry for information
that is relevent to Cygwin programs.  These registry entries are the
ones that have "Cygwin" in the name.  If you are paranoid about
privacy, you may remove information from this report, but please keep
in mind that doing so makes it harder to diagnose your problems.</para>

<para>In contrast to the other options that search the packages that are
installed on your local system, the <literal>-p</literal> option can be used
to search the entire official Cygwin package repository.  It takes as argument
a Perl-compatible regular expression which is used to match package names, 
package descriptions, and path/filenames of the contents of packages.  This
feature requires an active internet connection, since it must query the
<literal>cygwin.com</literal> web site.  In fact, it is equalivant to the
search that is available on the <ulink url="http://cygwin.com/packages/">Cygwin
package listing</ulink> page.</para>

<para>For example, perhaps you are getting an error because you are missing a
certain DLL and you want to know which package includes that file:
<example id="utils-search-ex"><title>Searching all packages for a file</title>
<screen>
$ cygcheck -p 'cygintl-2\.dll'
Found 1 matches for 'cygintl-2\.dll'.

libintl2-0.12.1-3         GNU Internationalization runtime library

$ cygcheck -p 'libexpat.*\.a'
Found 2 matches for 'libexpat.*\.a'.

expat-1.95.7-1            XML parser library written in C
expat-1.95.8-1            XML parser library written in C

$ cygcheck -p '/ls\.exe'
Found 2 matches for '/ls\.exe'.

coreutils-5.2.1-5         GNU core utilities (includes fileutils, sh-utils and textutils)
coreutils-5.3.0-6         GNU core utilities (includes fileutils, sh-utils and textutils)
</screen>
</example>
</para>

<para>Note that this option takes a regular expression, not a glob or wildcard.
This means that you need to use <literal>.*</literal> if you want something
similar to the wildcard <literal>*</literal> commonly used in filename globbing.
Similarly, to match the period character you should use <literal>\.</literal>
since the <literal>.</literal> character in a regexp is a metacharacter that
will match any character.  Also be aware that the characters such as 
<literal>\</literal> and <literal>*</literal> are shell metacharacters, so 
they must be either escaped or quoted, as in the example above.</para>

<para>The third example above illustrates that if you want to match a whole 
filename, you should include the <literal>/</literal> path seperator.  In the
given example this ensures that filenames that happen to end in
<literal>ls.exe</literal> such as <literal>ncftpls.exe</literal> are not shown.
Note that this use does not mean "look for packages with <literal>ls</literal>
in the root directory," since the <literal>/</literal> can match anywhere in the
path.  It's just there to anchor the match so that it matches a full
filename.</para>

<para>By default the matching is case-sensitive.  To get a case insensitive
match, begin your regexp with <literal>(?i)</literal> which is a PCRE-specific
feature.  For complete documentation on Perl-compatible regular expression
syntax and options, read the <command>perlre</command> manpage, or one of many
websites such as <literal>perldoc.com</literal> that document the Perl
language.</para>

<para>The <command>cygcheck</command> program should be used to send
information about your system for troubleshooting when requested.  
When asked to run this command save the output so that you can email it,
for example:</para>

<screen>
<prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>cygcheck -s -v -r -h &gt; cygcheck_output.txt</userinput>
</screen>

<para>
Each Cygwin DLL stores its path and installation key in the registry.
This allows troubleshooting of problems which could be a result of having
multiple concurrent Cygwin installations.  However, if you're experimenting
a lot with different Cygwin installation paths, your registry could 
accumulate a lot of old Cygwin installation entries for which the
installation doesn't exist anymore.  To get rid of these orphaned registry
entries, use the <command>cygcheck --delete-orphaned-installation-keys</command>
command.</para>

<para>
Each Cygwin DLL generates a key value from its installation path.  This
value is not only stored in the registry, it's also used to generate
global object names used for interprocess communication.   This keeps
different Cygwin installations separate.  Processes running under a
Cygwin DLL installed in C:\cygwin don't see processes running under a
Cygwin DLL installed in C:\Program Files\cygwin.  This allows
running multiple versions of Cygwin DLLs without these versions to
interfere with each other, or to run small third-party installations
for a specific purpose independently from a Cygwin net distribution.
</para>

<para>
For debugging purposes it could be desired that the various Cygwin DLLs
use the same key, independently from their installation paths.  If the
DLLs have different versions, trying to run processes under these DLLs
concurrently will result in error messages like this one:</para>

<screen>
*** shared version mismatch detected - 0x8A88009C/0x75BE0074.
This problem is probably due to using incompatible versions of the cygwin DLL.
Search for cygwin1.dll using the Windows Start->Find/Search facility
and delete all but the most recent version.  The most recent version *should*
reside in x:\\cygwin\\bin, where 'x' is the drive on which you have
installed the cygwin distribution.  Rebooting is also suggested if you
are unable to find another cygwin DLL.
</screen>

<para>
To disable the usage of a unique key value of a certain Cygwin DLL, use
the <command>cygcheck --disable-unique-object-names Cygwin-DLL</command>
command.  <literal>Cygwin-DLL</literal> is the Windows path (*not* a 
Cygwin POSIX path) to the DLL for which you want to disable this feature.
Note that you have to stop all Cygwin processes running under this DLL,
before you're allowed to change this setting.  For instance, run
<command>cygcheck</command> from a DOS command line for this purpose.</para>

<para>To re-enable the usage of a unique key, use the
<command>cygcheck --enable-unique-object-names Cygwin-DLL</command> command.
This option has the same characteristics as the
<literal>--disable-unique-object-names</literal> option</para>

<para>Finally, you can use
<command>cygcheck --show-unique-object-names Cygwin-DLL</command> to find out
if the given Cygwin DLL use unique object names or not.  In contrast to the
<literal>--disable-...</literal> and <literal>--enable-...</literal> options,
the <literal>--show-unique-object-names</literal> option also works for
Cygwin DLLs which are currently in use.</para>

<sect2 id="cygpath"><title>cygpath</title>

<screen>
Usage: cygpath (-d|-m|-u|-w|-t TYPE) [-f FILE] [OPTION]... NAME...
       cygpath [-c HANDLE] 
       cygpath [-ADHOPSW] 
       cygpath [-F ID] 
Convert Unix and Windows format paths, or output system path information

Output type options:
  -d, --dos             print DOS (short) form of NAMEs (C:\PROGRA~1\)
  -m, --mixed           like --windows, but with regular slashes (C:/WINNT)
  -M, --mode            report on mode of file (currently binmode or textmode)
  -u, --unix            (default) print Unix form of NAMEs (/cygdrive/c/winnt)
  -w, --windows         print Windows form of NAMEs (C:\WINNT)
  -t, --type TYPE       print TYPE form: 'dos', 'mixed', 'unix', or 'windows'
Path conversion options:
  -a, --absolute        output absolute path
  -l, --long-name       print Windows long form of NAMEs (with -w, -m only)
  -p, --path            NAME is a PATH list (i.e., '/bin:/usr/bin')
  -s, --short-name      print DOS (short) form of NAMEs (with -w, -m only)
  -C, --codepage CP     print DOS, Windows, or mixed pathname in Windows
                        codepage CP.  CP can be a numeric codepage identifier,
                        or one of the reserved words ANSI, OEM, or UTF8.
                        If this option is missing, cygpath defaults to the
                        character set defined by the current locale.
System information:
  -A, --allusers        use `All Users' instead of current user for -D, -P
  -D, --desktop         output `Desktop' directory and exit
  -H, --homeroot        output `Profiles' directory (home root) and exit
  -O, --mydocs          output `My Documents' directory and exit
  -P, --smprograms      output Start Menu `Programs' directory and exit
  -S, --sysdir          output system directory and exit
  -W, --windir          output `Windows' directory and exit
  -F, --folder ID       output special folder with numeric ID and exit
Other options:
  -f, --file FILE       read FILE for input; use - to read from STDIN
  -o, --option          read options from FILE as well (for use with --file)
  -c, --close HANDLE    close HANDLE (for use in captured process)
  -i, --ignore          ignore missing argument
  -h, --help            output usage information and exit
  -v, --version         output version information and exit
</screen>

<para>The <command>cygpath</command> program is a utility that
converts Windows native filenames to Cygwin POSIX-style pathnames and
vice versa.  It can be used when a Cygwin program needs to pass a file 
name to a native Windows program, or expects to get a file name from a
native Windows program.  Alternatively, <command>cygpath</command> can 
output information about the location of important system directories 
in either format.  
</para>

<para>The <literal>-u</literal> and <literal>-w</literal> options
indicate whether you want a conversion to UNIX (POSIX) format 
(<literal>-u</literal>) or to Windows format (<literal>-w</literal>).  
Use the <literal>-d</literal> to get DOS-style (8.3) file and path names.
The <literal>-m</literal> option will output Windows-style format
but with forward slashes instead of backslashes.  This option is 
especially useful in shell scripts, which use backslashes as an escape 
character.</para>

<para> In combination with the <literal>-w</literal> option, you can use
the <literal>-l</literal> and <literal>-s</literal> options to use normal
(long) or DOS-style (short) form. The <literal>-d</literal> option is 
identical to <literal>-w</literal> and <literal>-s</literal> together.
</para>

<para>The <literal>-C</literal> option allows to specify a Windows codepage
to print DOS and Windows paths created with one of the <literal>-d</literal>,
<literal>-m</literal>, or <literal>-w</literal> options.  The default is to
use the character set of the current locale defined by one of the
internationalization environment variables <envar>LC_ALL</envar>,
<envar>LC_CTYPE</envar>, or <envar>LANG</envar>, see
<xref linkend="setup-locale"></xref>.  This is sometimes not sufficent for
interaction with native Windows tools, which might expect native, non-ASCII
characters in a specific Windows codepage.  Console tools, for instance, might
expect pathnames in the current OEM codepage, while graphical tools like
Windows Explorer might expect pathnames in the current ANSI codepage.</para>

<para>The <literal>-C</literal> option takes a single parameter:</para>
<itemizedlist spacing="compact">
<listitem><para><literal>ANSI</literal>, to specify the current ANSI codepage</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><literal>OEM</literal>, to specify the current OEM (console) codepage</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><literal>UTF8</literal>, to specify UTF-8.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>A numerical, decimal codepage number, for instance 936 for GBK,
28593 for ISO-8859-3, etc.  A full list of supported codepages is listed on the
Microsoft MSDN page
<ulink url="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd317756(VS.85).aspx">Code Page Identifiers</ulink>.  A codepage of 0 is the same as if the
<literal>-C</literal> hasn't been specified at all.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>The <literal>-p</literal> option means that you want to convert
a path-style string rather than a single filename.  For example, the
PATH environment variable is semicolon-delimited in Windows, but
colon-delimited in UNIX.  By giving <literal>-p</literal> you are
instructing <command>cygpath</command> to convert between these
formats.</para>

<para>The <literal>-i</literal> option supresses the print out of the
usage message if no filename argument was given.  It can be used in
make file rules converting variables that may be omitted
to a proper format.  Note that <command>cygpath</command> output may 
contain spaces (C:\Program Files) so should be enclosed in quotes.

<para>The capital options 
<literal>-D</literal>, <literal>-H</literal>, <literal>-P</literal>, 
<literal>-S</literal>, and <literal>-W</literal> output directories used 
by Windows that are not the same on all systems, for example 
<literal>-S</literal> might output C:\WINNT\system32 or C:\Windows\System32. 
The <literal>-H</literal> shows the Windows profiles directory that can 
be used as root of home.  The <literal>-A</literal> option forces use of 
the "All Users" directories instead of the current user for the 
<literal>-D</literal>, <literal>-O</literal> and <literal>-P</literal> 
options.
The <literal>-F</literal> outputs other special folders specified by
their internal numeric code (decimal or 0xhex). For valid codes and
symbolic names, see the CSIDL_* definitions in the include file
/usr/include/w32api/shlobj.h from package w32api. The current valid
range of codes for folders is 0 (Desktop) to 59 (CDBurn area).
By default the output is in UNIX (POSIX) format; 
use the <literal>-w</literal> or <literal>-d</literal> options to get
other formats.</para>

<sect2 id="dumper"><title>dumper</title>

<screen>
Usage: dumper [OPTION] FILENAME WIN32PID
Dump core from WIN32PID to FILENAME.core

-d, --verbose  be verbose while dumping
-h, --help     output help information and exit
-q, --quiet    be quiet while dumping (default)
-v, --version  output version information and exit
</screen>

<para>The <command>dumper</command> utility can be used to create a
core dump of running Windows process. This core dump can be later loaded
to <command>gdb</command> and analyzed. One common way to use 
<command>dumper</command> is to plug it into cygwin's Just-In-Time 
debugging facility by adding

<screen>
error_start=x:\path\to\dumper.exe
</screen>

to the <emphasis>CYGWIN</emphasis> environment variable. Please note that
<literal>x:\path\to\dumper.exe</literal> is Windows-style and not cygwin
path. If <literal>error_start</literal> is set this way, then dumper will
be started whenever some program encounters a fatal error.
</para>

<para>
<command>dumper</command> can be also be started from the command line to 
create a core dump of any running process. Unfortunately, because of a Windows 
API limitation, when a core dump is created and <command>dumper</command> 
exits, the target process is terminated too.
</para>

<para>
To save space in the core dump, <command>dumper</command> doesn't write those
portions of target process' memory space that are loaded from executable and
dll files and are unchangeable, such as program code and debug info. Instead,
<command>dumper</command> saves paths to files which contain that data. When a
core dump is loaded into gdb, it uses these paths to load appropriate files.
That means that if you create a core dump on one machine and try to debug it on
another, you'll need to place identical copies of the executable and dlls in 
the same directories as on the machine where the core dump was created.
</para>

<sect2 id="getfacl"><title>getfacl</title>

<screen>
Usage: getfacl [-adn] FILE [FILE2...]
Display file and directory access control lists (ACLs).

  -a, --all      display the filename, the owner, the group, and
                 the ACL of the file
  -d, --dir      display the filename, the owner, the group, and
                 the default ACL of the directory, if it exists
  -h, --help     output usage information and exit
  -n, --noname   display user and group IDs instead of names
  -v, --version  output version information and exit

When multiple files are specified on the command line, a blank
line separates the ACLs for each file.
</screen>

<para>
For each argument that is a regular file, special file or
directory, <command>getfacl</command> displays the owner, the group, and the 
ACL.  For directories <command>getfacl</command> displays additionally the 
default ACL.  With no options specified, <command>getfacl</command> displays 
the filename, the owner, the group, and both the ACL and the default ACL, if 
it exists. For more information on Cygwin and Windows ACLs, see
<xref linkend="ntsec"></xref> in the Cygwin User's Guide.
The format for ACL output is as follows:
<screen>
     # file: filename
     # owner: name or uid
     # group: name or uid
     user::perm
     user:name or uid:perm
     group::perm
     group:name or gid:perm
     mask:perm
     other:perm

<sect2 id="getlocale"><title>getlocale</title>

<screen>
Usage: getlocale [-asuh]
Print Windows locale(s)

Options:

  -a, --all       List all available locales
  -s, --system    Print system default locale
                  (default is current user default locale)
  -u, --utf       Attach ".UTF-8" to the result
  -h, --help      this text
</screen>

<para><command>getlocale</command> without parameters just prints the
current user's Windows default locale to stdout.  The <literal>-s</literal>
option prints the systems default locale instead.  With the
<literal>-u</literal> option <command>getlocale</command> appends a ".UTF-8".
This can be used in scripts to set the Cygwin locale, for instance:
</para>

<screen>
bash$ export LANG=$(getlocale -u)
bash$ echo $LANG
en_US.UTF-8
</screen>

<para>The <literal>-a</literal> option is helpful to learn which locales
are supported by your Windows machine.  It prints the locales and their
actual meaning, like this:</para>

<screen>

<screen>
Usage: kill [-f] [-signal] [-s signal] pid1 [pid2 ...]
       kill -l [signal]
Send signals to processes

 -f, --force     force, using win32 interface if necessary
 -l, --list      print a list of signal names
 -s, --signal    send signal (use kill --list for a list)
 -h, --help      output usage information and exit
 -v, --version   output version information and exit
</screen>

<para>The <command>kill</command> program allows you to send arbitrary
signals to other Cygwin programs.  The usual purpose is to end a
running program from some other window when ^C won't work, but you can
also send program-specified signals such as SIGUSR1 to trigger actions
within the program, like enabling debugging or re-opening log files.
Each program defines the signals they understand.</para>

<para>You may need to specify the full path to use <command>kill</command> 
from within some shells, including <command>bash</command>, the default Cygwin
shell. This is because <command>bash</command> defines a 
<command>kill</command> builtin function; see the <command>bash</command>
man page under <emphasis>BUILTIN COMMANDS</emphasis> for more information.
To make sure you are using the Cygwin version, try

<screen>
$ /bin/kill --version
</screen>

which should give the Cygwin <command>kill</command> version number and
copyright information.
</para>

<para>Unless you specific the <literal>-f</literal> option, the "pid" values 
used by <command>kill</command> are the Cygwin pids, not the Windows pids.  
To get a list of running programs and their Cygwin pids, use the Cygwin
<command>ps</command> program. <command>ps -W</command> will display
<emphasis>all</emphasis> windows pids.</para>

<para>The <command>kill -l</command> option prints the name of the
given signal, or a list of all signal names if no signal is given.</para>

<para>To send a specific signal, use the <literal>-signN</literal>
option, either with a signal number or a signal name (minus the "SIG"
part), as shown in these examples:</para>

<para>The <command>mkgroup</command> program can be used to help
configure Cygwin by creating a <filename>/etc/group</filename>
file.  Its use is essential to include Windows security information.</para>

<para>The command is initially called by <command>setup.exe</command> to
create a default <filename>/etc/group</filename>.  This should be
sufficient in most circumstances.  However, especially when working
in a multi-domain environment, you can use <command>mkgroup</command>
manually to create a more complete <filename>/etc/group</filename> file for
all domains.  Especially when you have the same group name used on
multiple machines or in multiple domains, you can use the <literal>-D</literal>,
<literal>-L</literal> and <literal>-C</literal> options to create unique
domain\group style groupnames.</para>
  
<para>Note that this information is static.  If you change the group
information in your system, you'll need to regenerate the group file
for it to have the new information.</para>

<para>The <literal>-d/-D</literal> and <literal>-l/-L</literal> options
allow you to specify where the information comes from, the
local SAM of a machine or from the domain, or both.
With the <literal>-d/-D</literal> options the program contacts a Domain
Controller, which my be unreachable or have restricted access.
Comma-separated from the machine or domain, you can specify an offset
which is used as base added to the group's RID to compute the gid
(offset + RID = gid).  This allows you to create the same gids every time you
re-run <command>mkgroup</command>.
For very simple needs, an entry for the current user's group can be
created by using the option <literal>-c</literal> or <literal>-C</literal>.
If you want to use one of the <literal>-D</literal>, <literal>-L</literal>
or <literal>-C</literal> options, but you don't like the backslash as
domain/group separator, you can specify another separator using the
<literal>-S</literal> option, for instance:</para>

The <literal>-g</literal> option only prints the information for one group.
The <literal>-U</literal> option allows you to enumerate the standard UNIX
groups on a Samba machine.  It's used together with

<para>The <command>mount</command> program is used to map your drives
and shares onto Cygwin's simulated POSIX directory tree, much like as is
done by mount commands on typical UNIX systems.  However, in contrast to
mount points given in <filename>/etc/fstab</filename>, mount points
created or changed with <command>mount</command> are not persistent.  They
disappear immediately after the last process of the current user exited.

<para>A given POSIX path may only exist once in the mount table.  Attempts to

<para>Note that all mount points added with <command>mount</command> are
user mount points.  System mount points can only be specified in

<para>If you added mount points to <filename>/etc/fstab</filename> or your
<filename>/etc/fstab.d/&lt;username&gt;</filename> file, you can add these
mount points to your current user session using the <literal>-a/--all</literal>
option, or by specifing the posix path alone on the command line.  As an
example, consider you added a mount point with the POSIX path
<filename>/my/mount</filename>.  You can add this mount point with either
one of the following two commands to your current user session.</para>

<screen>
<prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>mount /my/mount</userinput>
<prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>mount -a</userinput>

<para>The first command just adds the <filename>/my/mount</filename> mount
point to your current session, the <command>mount -a</command> adds all
new mount points to your user session.</para>

<para>If you change a mount point to point to another native path, or
if you changed the flags of a mount point, you have to <command>umount</command>
the mount point first, before you can add it again.  Please note that
all such added mount points are added as user mount points, and that the
rule that system mount points can't be removed or replaced in a running

<sect3 id="utils-cygdrive"><title>Cygdrive mount points</title>

<para>Whenever Cygwin cannot use any of the existing mounts to convert
from a particular Win32 path to a POSIX one, Cygwin will, instead,
convert to a POSIX path using a default mount point:
<filename>/cygdrive</filename>.  For example, if Cygwin accesses
<filename>z:\foo</filename> and the z drive is not currently in the
mount table, then <filename>z:\</filename> will be accessible as
<filename>/cygdrive/z</filename>.  The <command>mount</command> utility 
can be used to change this default automount prefix through the use of the
"--change-cygdrive-prefix" option.  In the following example, we will
set the automount prefix to <filename>/mnt</filename>:</para>

<example id="utils-cygdrive-ex">
<title>Changing the default prefix</title>
<screen>
<prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>mount --change-cygdrive-prefix /mnt</userinput>
</screen>
</example>

<para>Note that the cygdrive prefix can be set both per-user and system-wide, 
and that as with all mounts, a user-specific mount takes precedence over the 
system-wide setting.  The <command>mount</command> utility creates system-wide 
mounts by default if you do not specify a type.
You can always see the user and system cygdrive prefixes with the 
<literal>-p</literal> option.  Using the <literal>--options</literal>
flag with <literal>--change-cygdrive-prefix</literal> makes all new 
automounted filesystems default to this set of options.  For instance
(using the short form of the command line flags)</para>

<example id="utils-cygdrive-ex2">

<sect3 id="utils-limitations"><title>Limitations</title>

<para>Limitations: there is a hard-coded limit of 30 mount
points.  Also, although you can mount to pathnames that do not start
with "/", there is no way to make use of such mount points.</para>

<para>Normally the POSIX mount point in Cygwin is an existing empty
directory, as in standard UNIX. If this is the case, or if there is a
place-holder for the mount point (such as a file, a symbolic link
pointing anywhere, or a non-empty directory), you will get the expected
behavior. Files present in a mount point directory before the mount
become invisible to Cygwin programs.
</para>

<para>It is sometimes desirable to mount to a non-existent directory,
for example to avoid cluttering the root directory with names
such as
<filename>a</filename>, <filename>b</filename>, <filename>c</filename>
pointing to disks.
Although <command>mount</command> will give you a warning, most
everything will work properly when you refer to the mount point
explicitly.  Some strange effects can occur however.
For example if your current working directory is
<filename>/dir</filename>,
say, and <filename>/dir/mtpt</filename> is a mount point, then
<filename>mtpt</filename> will not show up in an <command>ls</command>
or

Usage: passwd [OPTION] [USER]
Change USER's password or password attributes.

User operations:
  -l, --lock               lock USER's account.
  -u, --unlock             unlock USER's account.
  -c, --cannot-change      USER can't change password.
  -C, --can-change         USER can change password.
  -e, --never-expires      USER's password never expires.
  -E, --expires            USER's password expires according to system's
                           password aging rule.
  -p, --pwd-not-required   no password required for USER.
  -P, --pwd-required       password is required for USER.
  -R, --reg-store-pwd      enter password to store it in the registry for
                           later usage by services to be able to switch
                           to this user context with network credentials.

System operations:
  -i, --inactive NUM       set NUM of days before inactive accounts are disabled
                           (inactive accounts are those with expired passwords).
  -n, --minage DAYS        set system minimum password age to DAYS days.
  -x, --maxage DAYS        set system maximum password age to DAYS days.
  -L, --length LEN         set system minimum password length to LEN.

Other options:
  -d, --logonserver SERVER connect to SERVER (e.g. domain controller).
                           Default server is the local system, unless
                           changing the current user, in which case the
                           default is the content of $LOGONSERVER.
  -S, --status             display password status for USER (locked, expired,
                           etc.) plus global system password settings.
  -h, --help               output usage information and exit.
  -v, --version            output version information and exit.

If no option is given, change USER's password.  If no user name is given,
operate on current user.  System operations must not be mixed with user
operations.  Don't specify a USER when triggering a system operation. 

Don't specify a user or any other option together with the -R option.
Non-Admin users can only store their password if cygserver is running.
Note that storing even obfuscated passwords in the registry is not overly
secure.  Use this feature only if the machine is adequately locked down.
Don't use this feature if you don't need network access within a remote
session.  You can delete your stored password by using `passwd -R' and
specifying an empty password.

<para> <command>passwd</command> changes passwords for user accounts.
A normal user may only change the password for their own account,
but administrators may change passwords on any account.
<command>passwd</command> also changes account information, such as
password expiry dates and intervals.</para>

<para>For password changes, the user is first prompted for their old
password, if one is present.  This password is then encrypted and
compared against the stored password.  The user has only one chance to
enter the correct password.  The administrators are permitted to
bypass this step so that forgotten passwords may be changed.</para>

<para>The user is then prompted for a replacement password.
<command>passwd</command> will prompt twice for this replacement and 
compare the second entry against the first.  Both entries are required to 
match in order for the password to be changed.</para>

<para>After the password has been entered, password aging information
is checked to see if the user is permitted to change their password
at this time.  If not, <command>passwd</command> refuses to change the
password and exits.</para>

<para>
To get current password status information, use the
<literal>-S</literal> option. Administrators can use
<command>passwd</command> to perform several account maintenance
functions (users may perform some of these functions on their own
accounts).  Accounts may be locked with the <literal>-l</literal> flag
and unlocked with the <literal>-u</literal> flag.  Similarly,
<literal>-c</literal> disables a user's ability to change passwords, and
<literal>-C</literal> allows a user to change passwords.  For password
expiry, the <literal>-e</literal> option disables expiration, while the
<literal>-E</literal> option causes the password to expire according to
the system's normal aging rules.  Use <literal>-p</literal> to disable
the password requirement for a user, or <literal>-P</literal> to require
a password.
</para>

<para>Administrators can also use <command>passwd</command> to change
system-wide password expiry and length requirements with the
<literal>-i</literal>, <literal>-n</literal>, <literal>-x</literal>,
and <literal>-L</literal> options.  The <literal>-i</literal>
option is used to disable an account after the password has been expired
for a number of days.  After a user account has had an expired password
for <emphasis>NUM</emphasis> days, the user may no longer sign on to
the account.  The <literal>-n</literal> option is
used to set the minimum number of days before a password may be changed.
The user will not be permitted to change the password until
<emphasis>MINDAYS</emphasis> days have elapsed.  The
<literal>-x</literal> option is used to set the maximum number of days
a password remains valid.  After <emphasis>MAXDAYS</emphasis> days, the
password is required to be changed.  Allowed values for the above options 
are 0 to 999.  The <literal>-L</literal> option sets the minimum length of 
allowed passwords for users who don't belong to the administrators group
to <emphasis>LEN</emphasis> characters.  Allowed values for the minimum
password length are 0 to 14.  In any of the above cases, a value of 0
means `no restrictions'.</para>

<para>
All operations affecting the current user are by default run against
the logon server of the current user (taken from the environment
variable <envar>LOGONSERVER</envar>.  When password or account information
of other users should be changed, the default server is the local system.
To change a user account on a remote machine, use the <literal>-d</literal>
option to specify the machine to run the command against.  Note that the
current user must be a valid member of the administrators group on the remote
machine to perform such actions.
</para>

<para>Users can use the <command>passwd -R</command> to enter
a password which then gets stored in a special area of the registry on the
local system, which is also used by Windows to store passwords of accounts
running Windows services.  When a privileged Cygwin application calls the
<command>set{e}uid(user_id)</command> system call, Cygwin checks if a
password for that user has been stored in this registry area.  If so, it
uses this password to switch to this user account using that password.
This allows you to logon through, for instance, <command>ssh</command> with
public key authentication and get a full qualified user token with
all credentials for network access.  However, the method has some
drawbacks security-wise.  This is explained in more detail in
<xref linkend="ntsec"></xref>.</para>

<para>Please note that storing passwords in that registry area is a
privileged operation which only administrative accounts are allowed to
do.  If normal, non-admin users should be allowed to enter their
passwords using <command>passwd -R</command>, it's required to run
<command>cygserver</command> as a service under the LocalSystem account
before running <command>passwd -R</command>.  This only affects storing
passwords.  Using passwords in privileged processes does not require
<command>cygserver</command> to run.</para>

<para>Limitations: Users may not be able to change their password on
some systems.</para>

<sect2 id="ps"><title>ps</title>

<screen>
Usage: ps [-aefls] [-u UID]
Report process status

 -a, --all       show processes of all users
 -e, --everyone  show processes of all users
 -f, --full      show process uids, ppids
 -h, --help      output usage information and exit
 -l, --long      show process uids, ppids, pgids, winpids
 -p, --process   show information for specified PID
 -s, --summary   show process summary
 -u, --user      list processes owned by UID
 -v, --version   output version information and exit
 -W, --windows   show windows as well as cygwin processes
With no options, ps outputs the long format by default
</screen>

<para>The <command>ps</command> program gives the status of all the
Cygwin processes running on the system (ps = "process status").  Due
to the limitations of simulating a POSIX environment under Windows,
there is little information to give.  
</para>

<para>
The PID column is the process ID you need to give to the 
<command>kill</command> command. The PPID is the parent process ID,
and PGID is the process group ID.  The WINPID column is the process 
ID displayed by NT's Task Manager program. The TTY column gives which 
pseudo-terminal a process is running on, or a <literal>'?'</literal>
for services. The UID column shows which user owns each process. 
STIME is the time the process was started, and COMMAND gives the name
of the program running. Listings may also have a status flag in
column zero; <literal>S</literal> means stopped or suspended (in other
words, in the background), <literal>I</literal> means waiting for
input or interactive (foreground), and <literal>O</literal> means
waiting to output. 
</para>

<para>
By default, <command>ps</command> will only show processes owned by the
current user. With either the <literal>-a</literal> or <literal>-e</literal>
option, all user's processes (and system processes) are listed. There are
historical UNIX reasons for the synonomous options, which are functionally
identical. The <literal>-f</literal> option outputs a "full" listing with
usernames for UIDs. The <literal>-l</literal> option is the default display
mode, showing a "long" listing with all the above columns. The other display
option is <literal>-s</literal>, which outputs a shorter listing of just
PID, TTY, STIME, and COMMAND. The <literal>-u</literal> option allows you
to show only processes owned by a specific user. The <literal>-p</literal>
option allows you to show information for only the process with the
specified PID. The <literal>-W</literal>
option causes <command>ps</command> show non-Cygwin Windows processes as 
well as Cygwin processes. The WINPID is also the PID, and they can be killed
with the Cygwin <command>kill</command> command's <literal>-f</literal>
option.

<sect2 id="regtool"><title>regtool</title>

<screen>
Usage: regtool [OPTION] (add|check|get|list|remove|unset|load|unload|save) KEY
View or edit the Win32 registry

Actions:
 add KEY\SUBKEY             add new SUBKEY
 check KEY                  exit 0 if KEY exists, 1 if not
 get KEY\VALUE              prints VALUE to stdout
 list KEY                   list SUBKEYs and VALUEs
 remove KEY                 remove KEY
 set KEY\VALUE [data ...]   set VALUE
 unset KEY\VALUE            removes VALUE from KEY
 load KEY\SUBKEY PATH       load hive from PATH into new SUBKEY
 unload KEY\SUBKEY          unload hive and remove SUBKEY
 save KEY\SUBKEY PATH       save SUBKEY into new hive PATH

Options for 'list' Action:
 -k, --keys           print only KEYs
 -l, --list           print only VALUEs
 -p, --postfix        like ls -p, appends '\' postfix to KEY names

Options for 'get' Action:
 -b, --binary         print REG_BINARY data as hex bytes
 -n, --none           print data as stream of bytes as stored in registry
 -x, --hex            print numerical data as hex numbers

Options for 'set' Action:
 -b, --binary         set type to REG_BINARY (hex args or '-')
 -D, --dword-be       set type to REG_DWORD_BIG_ENDIAN
 -e, --expand-string  set type to REG_EXPAND_SZ
 -i, --integer        set type to REG_DWORD
 -m, --multi-string   set type to REG_MULTI_SZ
 -n, --none           set type to REG_NONE
 -Q, --qword          set type to REG_QWORD
 -s, --string         set type to REG_SZ

Options for 'set' and 'unset' Actions:
 -K&lt;c&gt;, --key-separator[=]&lt;c&gt;  set key separator to &lt;c&gt; instead of '\'

Other Options:
 -h, --help     output usage information and exit
 -q, --quiet    no error output, just nonzero return if KEY/VALUE missing
 -v, --verbose  verbose output, including VALUE contents when applicable
 -w, --wow64    access 64 bit registry view (ignored on 32 bit Windows)
 -W, --wow32    access 32 bit registry view (ignored on 32 bit Windows)
 -V, --version  output version information and exit

KEY is in the format [host]\prefix\KEY\KEY\VALUE, where host is optional
remote host in either \\hostname or hostname: format and prefix is any of:
  root     HKCR  HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT (local only)
  config   HKCC  HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG (local only)
  user     HKCU  HKEY_CURRENT_USER (local only)
  machine  HKLM  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
  users    HKU   HKEY_USERS

You can use forward slash ('/') as a separator instead of backslash, in
that case backslash is treated as escape character
Example: regtool.exe get '\user\software\Microsoft\Clock\iFormat'
</screen>

<para>The <command>regtool</command> program allows shell scripts
to access and modify the Windows registry.  Note that modifying the
Windows registry is dangerous, and carelessness here can result
in an unusable system.  Be careful.</para>

<para>The <literal>-v</literal> option means "verbose".  For most
commands, this causes additional or lengthier messages to be printed.
Conversely, the <literal>-q</literal> option supresses error messages,
so you can use the exit status of the program to detect if a key
exists or not (for example).</para>

<para>The <literal>-w</literal> option allows you to access the 64 bit view
of the registry.  Several subkeys exist in a 32 bit and a 64 bit version
when running on Windows 64.  Since Cygwin is running in 32 bit mode, it
only has access to the 32 bit view of these registry keys.  When using
the <literal>-w</literal> switch, the 64 bit view is used and
<command>regtool</command> can access the entire registry.
This option is simply ignored when running on 32 bit Windows versions.
</para>

<para>The <literal>-W</literal> option allows you to access the 32 bit view
on the registry.  The purpose of this option is mainly for symmetry.  It
permits creation of OS agnostic scripts which would also work in a hypothetical
64 bit version of Cygwin.</para>

<para>You must provide <command>regtool</command> with an 
<emphasis>action</emphasis> following options (if any). Currently,
the action must be <literal>add</literal>, <literal>set</literal>,
<literal>check</literal>, <literal>get</literal>, <literal>list</literal>,
<literal>remove</literal>, <literal>set</literal>, or <literal>unset</literal>.
</para>

<para>The <literal>add</literal> action adds a new key.  The 
<literal>check</literal> action checks to see if a key exists (the 
exit code of the program is zero if it does, nonzero if it does not).
The <literal>get</literal> action gets the value of a key,
and prints it (and nothing else) to stdout.  Note: if the value
doesn't exist, an error message is printed and the program returns a
non-zero exit code.  If you give <literal>-q</literal>, it doesn't
print the message but does return the non-zero exit code.</para>

<para>
The <literal>list</literal> action lists the subkeys and values
belonging to the given key. With <literal>list</literal>, the 
<literal>-k</literal> option instructs <command>regtool</command>
to print only KEYs, and the <literal>-l</literal> option to print
only VALUEs. The <literal>-p</literal> option postfixes a 
<literal>'/'</literal> to each KEY, but leave VALUEs with no
postfix.  The <literal>remove</literal> action 
removes a key.  Note that you may need to remove everything in the key 
before you may remove it, but don't rely on this stopping you from 
accidentally removing too much.  
</para>

<para>The <literal>get</literal> action prints a value within a key.
With the <literal>-b</literal> option, data is printed as hex bytes.
<literal>-n</literal> allows to print the data as a typeless stream of
bytes.  Integer values (REG_DWORD, REG_QWORD) are usually printed
as decimal values.  The <literal>-x</literal> option allows to print
the numbers as hexadecimal values.</para>

<para>The <literal>set</literal> action sets a value within a key.
<literal>-b</literal> means it's binary data (REG_BINARY).
The binary values are specified as hex bytes in the argument list.
If the argument is <literal>'-'</literal>, binary data is read
from stdin instead.
<literal>-d</literal> or <literal>-i</literal> means the value is a 32 bit
integer value (REG_DWORD).
<literal>-D</literal> means the value is a 32 bit integer value in
Big Endian representation (REG_DWORD_BIG_ENDIAN).
<literal>-Q</literal> means the value is a 64 bit integer value (REG_QWORD).
<literal>-s</literal> means the value is a string (REG_SZ).
<literal>-e</literal> means it's an expanding string (REG_EXPAND_SZ)
that contains embedded environment variables.  
<literal>-m</literal> means it's a multi-string (REG_MULTI_SZ).  
If you don't specify one of these, <command>regtool</command> tries to
guess the type based on the value you give.  If it looks like a
number, it's a DWORD, unless it's value doesn't fit into 32 bit, in which
case it's a QWORD.  If it starts with a percent, it's an expanding
string.  If you give multiple values, it's a multi-string.  Else, it's
a regular string.</para>

<para>The <literal>unset</literal> action removes a value from a key.</para>

<para>The <literal>load</literal> action adds a new subkey and loads
the contents of a registry hive into it.
The parent key must be HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE or HKEY_USERS.
The <literal>unload</literal> action unloads the file and removes
the subkey.
</para>

<para>The <literal>save</literal> action saves a subkey into a
registry hive.
</para>

<para>
By default, the last "\" or "/" is assumed to be the separator between the
key and the value.  You can use the <literal>-K</literal> option to provide 
an alternate key/value separator character.
</para>

SSP - The Single Step Profiler
</para>

<para>
Original Author:  DJ Delorie 
</para>

<para>
The SSP is a program that uses the Win32 debug API to run a program
one ASM instruction at a time.  It records the location of each
instruction used, how many times that instruction is used, and all
function calls.  The results are saved in a format that is usable by
the profiling program <command>gprof</command>, although 
<command>gprof</command> will claim the values
are seconds, they really are instruction counts.  More on that later.
</para>

<para>
Because the SSP was originally designed to profile the cygwin DLL, it
does not automatically select a block of code to report statistics on.
You must specify the range of memory addresses to keep track of
manually, but it's not hard to figure out what to specify.  Use the
"objdump" program to determine the bounds of the target's ".text"
section.  Let's say we're profiling cygwin1.dll.  Make sure you've
built it with debug symbols (else <command>gprof</command> won't run) 
and run objdump like this:

<screen>
$ objdump -h cygwin1.dll
</screen>

It will print a report like this:

The only information we're concerned with are the VMA of 
the .text section and the VMA of the section after it 
(sections are usually contiguous; you can also add the 
Size to the VMA to get the end address).  In this case, 
the VMA is 0x61001000 and the ending address is either 
0x61080000 (start of .data method) or 0x0x6107fa00 (VMA+Size
method).

<para>
There are two basic ways to use SSP - either profiling a whole
program, or selectively profiling parts of the program.
</para>

<para>
To profile a whole program, just run <command>ssp</command> without options.  
By default, it will step the whole program.  Here's a simple example, using 
the numbers above:

<screen>
$ ssp 0x61001000 0x61080000 hello.exe
</screen>

This will step the whole program.  It will take at least 8 minutes on
a PII/300 (yes, really).  When it's done, it will create a file called
"gmon.out".  You can turn this data file into a readable report with
<command>gprof</command>:

<screen>
$ gprof -b cygwin1.dll
</screen>

The "-b" means 'skip the help pages'.  You can omit this until you're
familiar with the report layout.  The <command>gprof</command> documentation 
explains a lot about this report, but <command>ssp</command> changes a few 
things.  For example, the first part of the report reports the amount of time 
spent in each function, like this:

<screen>
Each sample counts as 0.01 seconds.
  %   cumulative   self              self     total
 time   seconds   seconds    calls  ms/call  ms/call  name
 10.02    231.22    72.43       46  1574.57  1574.57  strcspn
  7.95    288.70    57.48      130   442.15   442.15  strncasematch
</screen>

The "seconds" columns are really CPU opcodes, 1/100 second per opcode.
So, "231.22" above means 23,122 opcodes.  The ms/call values are 10x
too big; 1574.57 means 157.457 opcodes per call.  Similar adjustments
need to be made for the "self" and "children" columns in the second
part of the report.
</para>

<para>
OK, so now we've got a huge report that took a long time to generate,
and we've identified a spot we want to work on optimizing.  Let's say
it's the time() function.  We can use SSP to selectively profile this
function by using OutputDebugString() to control SSP from within the
program.  Here's a sample program:

<screen>
	#include &lt;windows.h&gt;
	main()
	{
	  time_t t;
	  OutputDebugString("ssp on");
	  time(&amp;t);
	  OutputDebugString("ssp off");
	}
</screen>
</para>

<para>
Then, add the <literal>-d</literal> option to ssp to default to 
*disabling* profiling.  The program will run at full speed until the first 
OutputDebugString, then step until the second.
You can then use <command>gprof</command> (as usual) to see the performance 
profile for just that portion of the program's execution.
</para>

<para>
There are many options to ssp.  Since step-profiling makes your
program run about 1,000 times slower than normal, it's best to
understand all the options so that you can narrow down the parts
of your program you need to single-step.
</para>

<para>
<literal>-v</literal> - verbose.  This prints messages about threads 
starting and stopping, OutputDebugString calls, DLLs loading, etc.
</para>

<para>
<literal>-t</literal> and <literal>-c</literal> - tracing.  
With <literal>-t</literal>, *every* step's address is written
to the file "trace.ssp".  This can be used to help debug functions,
since it can trace multiple threads.  Clever use of scripts can match
addresses with disassembled opcodes if needed.  Warning: creates
*huge* files, very quickly.  <literal>-c</literal> prints each address to 
the console, useful for debugging key chunks of assembler.  Use 
<literal>addr2line -C -f -s -e foo.exe &lt; trace.ssp &gt; lines.ssp</literal>
and then <literal>perl cvttrace</literal> to convert to symbolic traces.
</para>

<para>
<literal>-s</literal> - subthreads.  Usually, you only need to trace the 
main thread, but sometimes you need to trace all threads, so this enables that.
It's also needed when you want to profile a function that only a
subthread calls.  However, using OutputDebugString automatically
enables profiling on the thread that called it, not the main thread.
</para>

<para>
<literal>-l</literal> - dll profiling.  Generates a pretty table of how much 
time was spent in each dll the program used.  No sense optimizing a function in
your program if most of the time is spent in the DLL.
I usually use the <literal>-v</literal>, <literal>-s</literal>, and 
<literal>-l</literal> options:

<screen>
$ ssp <literal>-v</literal> <literal>-s</literal> <literal>-l</literal> <literal>-d</literal> 0x61001000 0x61080000 hello.exe
</screen>
</para>

<para>The <command>strace</command> program executes a program, and
optionally the children of the program, reporting any Cygwin DLL output
from the program(s) to stdout, or to a file with the <literal>-o</literal>
option.  With the <literal>-w</literal> option, you can start an strace
session in a new window, for example:

<screen>
$ strace -o tracing_output -w sh -c 'while true; do echo "tracing..."; done' &amp;
</screen>
This is particularly useful for <command>strace</command> sessions that
take a long time to complete.
</para>

<para>
Note that <command>strace</command> is a standalone Windows program and so does 
not rely on the Cygwin DLL itself (you can verify this with 
<command>cygcheck</command>). As a result it does not understand symlinks.
This program is mainly useful for debugging the Cygwin DLL itself.</para>
