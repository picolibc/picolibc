What's new:
-----------

- New API call: getlocalename_l.

- New API calls: fdclosedir, posix_getdents.

- New API call: setproctitle.

- New API call: timespec_get.

- Add FS_IOC_[GS]ETFLAGS FS_PINNED_FL and FS_UNPINNED_FL flags to handle
  Windows attributes FILE_ATTRIBUTE_PINNED and FILE_ATTRIBUTE_UNPINNED.
  Add matching 'p' and 'u' mode bits in chattr(1) and lsattr(1).

- New libaio.a provided for projects checking for POSIX aio support
  by looking for this library at configure time.


What changed:
-------------

- ps -f now prints the commandline rather than the full path to the
  executable.

- Drop support for NT4 and Samba < 3.0.22.

- Now that SMBv1 is ultimately deprecated and not installed by default
  on latest Windows versions, use Network Discovery (i. e. WSD, "Web
  Service Discovery") for enumerating network servers in //, just like
  Windows Explorer.

- If "server" is given as FQDN, and if "server" is an NFS server,
  ls //server now also enumerates NFS shares.  If "server" is given
  as a flat name, only SMB shares are enumerated.

- Expose //tsclient (Microsoft Terminal Services) shares as well as
  //wsl$ (Plan 9 Network Provider) shares, i. e., WSL installation
  root dirs.

- Redesign pipe handling to minimize toggling blocking mode.
  The query_hdl stuff is no longer needed in new implementation.

- Now using AVX/AVX2/AVX-512 instructions in signal handler does not
  break their context.
