                        README for newlib-1.8.2 release
           (mostly cribbed from the README in the gdb-4.13 release)

This is `newlib', a simple ANSI C library, math library, and collection
of board support packages.

The newlib and libgloss subdirectories are a collection of software from
several sources, each with their own copyright.  See the file COPYING.NEWLIB
for details.  The rest of the release tree is under either the GNU GPL or
LPGL copyright.

Unpacking and Installation -- quick overview
==========================

When you unpack the newlib-1.8.2.tar.gz file, you'll find a directory
called `newlib-1.8.2', which contains:

COPYING          config/          install-sh*      mpw-configure
COPYING.LIB      config-ml.in     libgloss/        mpw-install
COPYING.NEWLIB   config.guess*    mkinstalldirs*   newlib/
CYGNUS           config.sub*      move-if-change*  symlink-tree*
ChangeLog        configure*       mpw-README       texinfo/
Makefile.in      configure.in     mpw-build.in
README           etc/             mpw-config.in

To build NEWLIB, you must follow the instructions in the section entitled
"Compiling NEWLIB in another directory".

This will configure and build all the libraries and crt0 (if one exists).
If `configure' can't determine your host system type, specify one as its
argument, e.g., sun4 or sun4sol2.  NEWLIB is most often used in cross
environments.

NOTE THAT YOU MUST HAVE ALREADY BUILT AND INSTALLED GCC and BINUTILS.


More Documentation
==================

   Newlib documentation is available on the net via:
   http://www.cygnus.com/pubs/gnupro

   All the documentation for NEWLIB comes as part of the machine-readable
distribution.  The documentation is written in Texinfo format, which is
a documentation system that uses a single source file to produce both
on-line information and a printed manual.  You can use one of the Info
formatting commands to create the on-line version of the documentation
and TeX (or `texi2roff') to typeset the printed version.

   If you want to format these Info files yourself, you need one of the
Info formatting programs, such as `texinfo-format-buffer' or `makeinfo'.

   If you want to typeset and print copies of this manual, you need TeX,
a program to print its DVI output files, and `texinfo.tex', the Texinfo
definitions file.

   TeX is a typesetting program; it does not print files directly, but
produces output files called DVI files.  To print a typeset document,
you need a program to print DVI files.  If your system has TeX
installed, chances are it has such a program.  The precise command to
use depends on your system; `lpr -d' is common; another (for PostScript
devices) is `dvips'.  The DVI print command may require a file name
without any extension or a `.dvi' extension.

   TeX also requires a macro definitions file called `texinfo.tex'. 
This file tells TeX how to typeset a document written in Texinfo
format.  On its own, TeX cannot read, much less typeset a Texinfo file.
`texinfo.tex' is distributed with NEWLIB and is located in the
`newlib-VERSION-NUMBER/texinfo' directory.



Compiling NEWLIB in another directory
=====================================

   If you want to run NEWLIB versions for several host or target machines,
you need a different `newlib' compiled for each combination of host and
target.  `configure' is designed to make this easy by allowing you to
generate each configuration in a separate subdirectory, rather than in
the source directory.  If your `make' program handles the `VPATH'
feature correctly (like GNU `make') running `make' in each of these
directories builds the `newlib' libraries specified there.

   To build `newlib' in a separate directory, run `configure' with the
`--srcdir' option to specify where to find the source. (You also need
to specify a path to find `configure' itself from your working
directory.  If the path to `configure' would be the same as the
argument to `--srcdir', you can leave out the `--srcdir' option; it
will be assumed.)

   For example, with version 1.8.2, you can build NEWLIB in a separate
directory for a Sun 4 cross m68k-aout environment like this:

     cd newlib-1.8.2
     mkdir ../newlib-m68k-aout
     cd ../newlib-m68k-aout
     ../newlib-1.8.2/configure --host=sun4 --target=m68k-aout
     make

   When `configure' builds a configuration using a remote source
directory, it creates a tree for the binaries with the same structure
(and using the same names) as the tree under the source directory.  In
the example, you'd find the Sun 4 library `libiberty.a' in the
directory `newlib-m68k-aout/libiberty', and NEWLIB itself in
`newlib-m68k-aout/newlib'.

   When you run `make' to build a program or library, you must run it
in a configured directory--whatever directory you were in when you
called `configure' (or one of its subdirectories).

   The `Makefile' that `configure' generates in each source directory
also runs recursively.  If you type `make' in a source directory such
as `newlib-1.8.2' (or in a separate configured directory configured with
`--srcdir=PATH/newlib-1.8.2'), you will build all the required libraries.

   When you have multiple hosts or targets configured in separate
directories, you can run `make' on them in parallel (for example, if
they are NFS-mounted on each of the hosts); they will not interfere
with each other.


Specifying names for hosts and targets
======================================

   The specifications used for hosts and targets in the `configure'
script are based on a three-part naming scheme, but some short
predefined aliases are also supported.  The full naming scheme encodes
three pieces of information in the following pattern:

     ARCHITECTURE-VENDOR-OS

   For example, you can use the alias `sun4' as a HOST argument or in a
`--target=TARGET' option.  The equivalent full name is
`sparc-sun-sunos4'.

   The `configure' script accompanying NEWLIB does not provide any query
facility to list all supported host and target names or aliases. 
`configure' calls the Bourne shell script `config.sub' to map
abbreviations to full names; you can read the script, if you wish, or
you can use it to test your guesses on abbreviations--for example:

     % sh config.sub sun4
     sparc-sun-sunos4.1.1
     % sh config.sub sun3
     m68k-sun-sunos4.1.1
     % sh config.sub decstation
     mips-dec-ultrix4.2
     % sh config.sub hp300bsd
     m68k-hp-bsd
     % sh config.sub i386v
     i386-pc-sysv
     % sh config.sub i786v
     Invalid configuration `i786v': machine `i786v' not recognized


`configure' options
===================

   Here is a summary of the `configure' options and arguments that are
most often useful for building NEWLIB.  `configure' also has several other
options not listed here.

     configure [--help]
               [--prefix=DIR]
               [--srcdir=PATH]
               [--target=TARGET] HOST

You may introduce options with a single `-' rather than `--' if you
prefer; but you may abbreviate option names if you use `--'.

`--help'
     Display a quick summary of how to invoke `configure'.

`--prefix=DIR'
     Configure the source to install programs and files in directory
     `DIR'.

`--exec-prefix=DIR'
     Configure the source to install host-dependent files in directory
     `DIR'.

`--srcdir=PATH'
     *Warning: using this option requires GNU `make', or another `make'
     that compatibly implements the `VPATH' feature.
     Use this option to make configurations in directories separate
     from the NEWLIB source directories.  Among other things, you can use
     this to build (or maintain) several configurations simultaneously,
     in separate directories.  `configure' writes configuration
     specific files in the current directory, but arranges for them to
     use the source in the directory PATH.  `configure' will create
     directories under the working directory in parallel to the source
     directories below PATH.

`--norecursion'
     Configure only the directory level where `configure' is executed;
     do not propagate configuration to subdirectories.

`--target=TARGET'
     Configure NEWLIB for running on the specified TARGET.

     There is no convenient way to generate a list of all available
     targets.

`HOST ...'
     Configure NEWLIB to be built using a cross compiler running on
     the specified HOST.

     There is no convenient way to generate a list of all available
     hosts.


Reporting Bugs
==============

The correct address for reporting bugs found in NEWLIB is
"newlib@sourceware.cygnus.com".  Please email all bug reports to that
address.  Please include the NEWLIB version number (e.g., newlib-1.8.2),
and how you configured it (e.g., "sun4 host and m68k-aout target").
Since NEWLIB supports many different configurations, it is important
that you be precise about this.
