/**  The strtod() function converts the initial portion of the string pointed
     to by \a nptr to double representation.

     The expected form of the string is an optional plus ( \c '+' ) or minus
     sign ( \c '-' ) followed by a sequence of digits optionally containing
     a decimal-point character, optionally followed by an exponent.  An
     exponent consists of an \c 'E' or \c 'e', followed by an optional plus
     or minus sign, followed by a sequence of digits.

     Leading white-space characters in the string are skipped.

     The strtod() function returns the converted value, if any.

     If \a endptr is not \c NULL, a pointer to the character after the last
     character used in the conversion is stored in the location referenced by
     \a endptr.

     If no conversion is performed, zero is returned and the value of
     \a nptr is stored in the location referenced by \a endptr.

     If the correct value would cause overflow, plus or minus \c INFINITY is
     returned (according to the sign of the value), and \c ERANGE is stored
     in \c errno.  If the correct value would cause underflow, zero is
     returned and \c ERANGE is stored in \c errno.
