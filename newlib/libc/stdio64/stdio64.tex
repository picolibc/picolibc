@chapter Large File Input and Output (@file{stdio.h}) 

This chapter comprises additional functions to manage large files which
are potentially larger than 2GB.

The underlying facilities for input and output depend on the host
system, but these functions provide a uniform interface.

The corresponding declarations are in @file{stdio.h}.

@menu
* Function fdopen64::    Turn open large file into a stream
* Function fopen64::     Open a large file
* Function freopen64::   Open a large file using an existing file descriptor
* Function fsetpos64::   Restore position of a large stream or file
* Function fgetpos64::   Get position of a large stream or file
* Function ftello64::    Return position in a large stream or file
* Function fseeko64::    Set large file position
* Function tmpfile64::   Create a temporary large file
