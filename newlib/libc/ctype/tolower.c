FUNCTION
	<<tolower>>, <<tolower_l>>---translate characters to lowercase

INDEX
	tolower

INDEX
	tolower_l

INDEX
	_tolower

SYNOPSIS
	#include <ctype.h>
	int tolower(int <[c]>);
	int _tolower(int <[c]>);

	#include <ctype.h>
	int tolower_l(int <[c]>, locale_t <[locale]>);


DESCRIPTION
<<tolower>> is a macro which converts uppercase characters to lowercase,
leaving all other characters unchanged.  It is only defined when
<[c]> is an integer in the range <<EOF>> to <<255>>.

<<tolower_l>> is like <<tolower>> but performs the function based on the
locale specified by the locale object locale.  If <[locale]> is
LC_GLOBAL_LOCALE or not a valid locale object, the behaviour is undefined.

You can use a compiled subroutine instead of the macro definition by
undefining this macro using `<<#undef tolower>>' or `<<#undef tolower_l>>'.

<<_tolower>> performs the same conversion as <<tolower>>, but should
only be used when <[c]> is known to be an uppercase character (<<A>>--<<Z>>).

RETURNS
<<tolower>>, <<tolower_l>> return the lowercase equivalent of <[c]> when
<[c]> is an uppercase character, and <[c]> otherwise.

<<_tolower>> returns the lowercase equivalent of <[c]> when it is a
character between <<A>> and <<Z>>.  If <[c]> is not one of these
characters, the behaviour of <<_tolower>> is undefined.

PORTABILITY
<<tolower>> is ANSI C.  <<_tolower>> is not recommended for portable programs.
<<tolower_l>> is POSIX-1.2008.

No supporting OS subroutines are required.
