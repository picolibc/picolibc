FUNCTION
	<<isgraph>>, <<isgraph_l>>---printable character predicates

INDEX
	isgraph

INDEX
	isgraph_l

SYNOPSIS
	#include <ctype.h>
	int isgraph(int <[c]>);

	#include <ctype.h>
	int isgraph_l(int <[c]>, locale_t <[locale]>);

DESCRIPTION
<<isgraph>> behaves identically to <<isprint>>, except that space characters
are excluded.

<<isgraph_l>> is like <<isgraph>> but perform the check based on the
locale specified by the locale object locale.  If <[locale]> is
LC_GLOBAL_LOCALE or not a valid locale object, the behaviour is
undefined.

You can use a compiled subroutine instead of the macro definition by
undefining either macro using `<<#undef isgraph>>', or `<<#undef
isgraph_l>>'.

RETURNS
<<isgraph>>, <<isgraph_l>> return non-zero if <[c]> is a printing character
except spaces.

PORTABILITY
<<isgraph>> is ANSI C.

No supporting OS subroutines are required.
