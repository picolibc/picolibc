FUNCTION
<<gmtime>>---convert time to UTC traditional form

INDEX
	gmtime
INDEX
	gmtime_r

SYNOPSIS
	#include <time.h>
	struct tm *gmtime(const time_t *<[clock]>);
	struct tm *gmtime_r(const time_t *<[clock]>, struct tm *<[res]>);

DESCRIPTION
<<gmtime>> takes the time at <[clock]> representing the number
of elapsed seconds since 00:00:00 on January 1, 1970, Universal
Coordinated Time (UTC, also known in some countries as GMT,
Greenwich Mean time) and converts it to a <<struct tm>>
representation.

<<gmtime>> constructs the traditional time representation in static
storage; each call to <<gmtime>> or <<localtime>> will overwrite the
information generated by previous calls to either function.

RETURNS
A pointer to the traditional time representation (<<struct tm>>).

PORTABILITY
ANSI C requires <<gmtime>>.

<<gmtime>> requires no supporting OS subroutines.
