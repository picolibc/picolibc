FUNCTION
<<tmpfile>>---create a temporary file

INDEX
	tmpfile
INDEX
	_tmpfile_r

SYNOPSIS
	#include <stdio.h>
	FILE *tmpfile(void);

	FILE *_tmpfile_r(struct _reent *<[reent]>);

DESCRIPTION
Create a temporary file (a file which will be deleted automatically),
using a name generated by <<tmpnam>>.  The temporary file is opened with
the mode <<"wb+">>, permitting you to read and write anywhere in it
as a binary file (without any data transformations the host system may
perform for text files).

The alternate function <<_tmpfile_r>> is a reentrant version.  The
argument <[reent]> is a pointer to a reentrancy structure.

RETURNS
<<tmpfile>> normally returns a pointer to the temporary file.  If no
temporary file could be created, the result is NULL, and <<errno>>
records the reason for failure.

PORTABILITY
Both ANSI C and the System V Interface Definition (Issue 2) require
<<tmpfile>>.

Supporting OS subroutines required: <<close>>, <<fstat>>, <<getpid>>,
<<isatty>>, <<lseek>>, <<open>>, <<read>>, <<sbrk>>, <<write>>.

<<tmpfile>> also requires the global pointer <<environ>>.
