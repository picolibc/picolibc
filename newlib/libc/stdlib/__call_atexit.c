Common routine to implement atexit-like functionality.

This is also the key function to be configured as lite exit, a size-reduced
implementation of exit that doesn't invoke clean-up functions such as _fini
or global destructors.

Default (without lite exit) call graph is like:
start -> atexit -> __register_exitproc
start -> __libc_init_array -> __cxa_atexit -> __register_exitproc
on_exit -> __register_exitproc
start -> exit -> __call_exitprocs

Here an -> means arrow tail invokes arrow head. All invocations here
are non-weak reference in current newlib.

Lite exit makes some of above calls as weak reference, so that size expansive
functions __register_exitproc and __call_exitprocs may not be linked. These
calls are:
start w-> atexit
cxa_atexit w-> __register_exitproc
exit w-> __call_exitprocs

Lite exit also makes sure that __call_exitprocs will be referenced as non-weak
whenever __register_exitproc is referenced as non-weak.

Thus with lite exit libs, a program not explicitly calling atexit or on_exit
will escape from the burden of cleaning up code. A program with atexit or on_exit
will work consistently to normal libs.

Lite exit is enabled with --enable-lite-exit, and is controlled with macro
LITE_EXIT.

   do that, then your startup code need not contain references to
   "atexit" or "exit".  As a result, only applications that reference
   "exit" explicitly will pull in finalization code.

   The choice of whether to register finalizers from libc or from
   startup code is deferred to link-time, rather than being a

   used with multiple BSPs, some of which register finalizers from
